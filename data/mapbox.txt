### DOCUMENT/ Privacy Policy / https://www.mapbox.com/legal/privacy ###
Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to information that Mapbox, Inc. and/or its affiliates (“we”) collect (A) when you use any of our websites, APIs or other online services (collectively, our “Services”), including third-party products and services that integrate with our Services, and (B) when you use third-party websites and applications that cite this privacy policy to provide us with feedback, event or shipping-related information (collectively, our “Vendors”).

This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, what we do with it, and your options regarding our collection and use of that data.

Corporate Accounts: If your account with us lists a corporate email address (a “Corporate Email”), then all references to “you” in this Privacy Policy shall also include the person or legal entity that controls the Corporate Email (for example, a person whose email is name@mapbox.com would be considered a Corporate Account of Mapbox). If you don’t want your account to be a Corporate Account, you should use a personal non-corporate email address. For clarification, commonly known personal email account services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook) are not Corporate Email.

Information We Collect
Account Information: If you sign up for or authenticate into an account with us, we may collect information that you provide to us in connection with setting up the account, such as your username, name, email address and, for an account you authenticate into, role. Further, in the course of using your account, you may provide us with additional information through your communications with us.
Payment Information: Payment is required for some of our Services, and we may ask you to provide certain information, including your name, address, email, and credit card information (collectively, “Payment Information”), in connection with processing your transactions. You may update your Payment Information through your account. All credit card processing for our Services is handled directly by our third-party PCI-certified payment provider, Stripe (and any information you provide to Stripe is governed by its privacy policy). Your Payment Information is encrypted and transmitted directly and securely to Stripe via HTTPS, and is not stored on our systems.
Information from Third Parties: We may receive information related to your use of our Vendor websites and services, including your username, name, email address, shipping address and your interaction with our Vendor. Common examples include signing up for an event or requesting shipment of a product from us. From time to time, we may also receive contact enrichment information from third parties.
Website Logs and Cookies: Whenever you visit or interact with our website, we automatically collect certain information about your browser and your interaction with our website, including (a) IP address, (b) browser and device type, (c) operating system, (d) referring web page, (e) the date and time of page visits, and (f) the pages accessed on our websites. We also use cookies and similar technologies to recognize and improve your use of our websites and, for accounts a user authenticated into, to retain records associated with each user, and you will not be able to access certain parts of our websites, including those that require a login, unless your device accepts cookies from us. You can find out more information about the cookies on our website and managing your browser’s cookie preferences for our website here.
APIs and Mobile SDKs: We automatically collect certain technical information whenever requests are made to our APIs or applications use our SDKs, including (a) IP address, (b) device and browser information, (c) operating system, (d) the content of the request, (e) the date and time of the request, and (f) limited location and usage data. We delete IP addresses after 30 days. In addition, when a mobile application uses our SDKs, it may send us certain limited location and usage data along with an ephemeral ID. We delete this ephemeral ID within 24 hours and do not associate it or the unprocessed mobile location data with any personally identifying information, including names, permanent IDs, email addresses, IP addresses, or phone numbers. We also collect randomly-generated IDs for the limited purpose of analyzing the use of our APIs and SDKs, including the number of active users. We will delete the randomly generated IDs and the content of requests made to our APIs after 36 months.
Vision SDK: We automatically collect certain information whenever the Vision SDK is in use, including (a) IP address, (b) device and browser information, (c) operating system, (d) the content of the API requests, (e) the date and time of the request, (f) limited location and usage data, (g) limited front-facing camera imagery and video, (h) a randomly generated ID, (i) accelerometer data and (j) detected road feature data.
Hosted Data: In using your account, you may upload data to us via Mapbox Studio, Mapbox Studio Classic, our Dataset API or our Upload API ("Hosted Data") so that Mapbox can host it for you as part of providing our Services. We delete Hosted Data upon your request, however, due to our highly available, distributed implementation of our hosting solution, artifacts of Hosted Data may remain on Mapbox systems after you delete the file in your account. We will delete those artifacts in accordance with our standard platform maintenance practices after we either receive a specific request from you to delete the Hosted Data artifacts (along with sufficient information to identify which data you want to ensure are deleted) or we receive a request from you to delete your account.
Feedback: You and/or your end users may provide us with feedback regarding our Services (e.g., in the form of email, suggestions for how to improve our maps, etc). We do not delete this information.

However, we will not transfer personal information outside of the European Union unless the recipient is subject to suitable contractual safeguards to ensure that the personal information is processed in accordance with EU law. For more information, please email us at privacy@mapbox.com.

Payment Information: We may disclose Payment Information to (a) our payment provider, Stripe, as described above in the “Information We Collect” section, (b) billing and accounting service providers acting on our behalf and (c) in connection with “Rare and Limited Disclosures” described below.
Website Logs and Cookies: We share information about your device and interaction with our website with our service providers that host our website and provide marketing and analytics services to us. Certain marketing and analytics services that integrate directly into our website may collect information about your device, browser, and interaction with our websites (including by placing third-party cookies on your browser or other similar technologies). We do not control how these third parties use or share this information, which is subject to their privacy policies. You can find out more information about the cookies on our website and managing your browser’s cookie preferences for our website here.
APIs and Mobile SDKs: We only share raw location data with our hosted infrastructure service providers. We share other data collected through your use of our APIs and SDKs with our hosted infrastructure and internal analytics service providers. In limited situations, we may also share API log data associated with a specific customer's account with that customer for the purpose of resolving billing questions. We also may share aggregated and anonymized usage statistics with other third parties.
Vision SDK: We share data collected through your use of Vision SDK with our hosted infrastructure and internal analytics service providers. In addition, we may share Vision SDK data with the person or entity that controls the account associated with the data. We also may share aggregated and anonymized usage statistics with other third parties.
Hosted Data: We use third parties to store, process and deliver the Hosted Data as directed by you (e.g., AWS and Cloudfront). We may share the Hosted Data with such service providers subject to obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We do not otherwise disclose Hosted Data except as directed by you or as described below in “Rare and Limited Disclosure”.
Feedback: We may share your feedback with third parties, including our third-party suppliers and partners who help us provide the Services.
Rare and Limited Disclosures: We may share information in our possession in response to a request if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation or legal process. For more information, see “Law Enforcement and Transparency,” below.
Furthermore, we may share information in our possession if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms of service, detect, prevent, or otherwise address threats to our platform, or protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Mapbox, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.
Finally, we may also share the information we collect in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company. We may also share information among our current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries and other companies under common control and ownership.
Your Choices About What We Do with the Information We Collect
Account and Payment Information: Certain account information is optional, and you may choose not to provide it to Mapbox. Note that some of this account and payment information is necessary for related Services to function properly – for example, if you do not provide payment information, you cannot take advantage of features that require payment.
Website Logs and Cookies: You may delete cookies from your computer, and most browsers provide the option to block cookies. Note that if you block cookies placed by us (first party cookies), portions of our Services, including our website, may not work as intended. However, your access to our websites should not be affected if you disable third-party cookies placed by third parties that manage marketing and analytics aspects of our website. You can find out more information about the cookies on our website and managing your browser’s cookie preferences for our website here.
APIs and Mobile SDKs: If you are an end user of a product or service that integrates our Services, your privacy options will be largely determined by the developer of the product or service. In addition to any privacy options that the developer may have provided you with, you may also be able to control the applications that can collect information about your precise location by using the settings available on your device, including opting out of collection of telemetry data.
Questions. If you have any questions about how to limit the disclosure and/or use of your personal information to us, please email us at privacy@mapbox.com.
Your Access to and Control of the Information We Collect
In General: If you believe that we hold information that would allow us to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate information about you or if you believe that information about you has been processed in violation of this privacy policy, applicable law or the Privacy Shield Principles (see “U.S.-EU Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield” below), please email us at privacy@mapbox.com.
Account Information, Hosted Data, and Payment Information: You may correct or change certain account information in the account pages we’ve made available to you, and you may update, correct or delete other Account Information, Hosted Data or Payment Information that you have provided to us at any time by emailing us at privacy@mapbox.com. If you wish to delete or deactivate your account, please email us at privacy@mapbox.com, but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or to protect our rights and property.
Website Logs, Cookies, APIs and Mobile SDKs: We temporarily retain IP addresses for security and accounting purposes. Given the temporary nature of this storage, it is generally not feasible for us to provide access to IP addresses or the logs associated with them.
Feedback: You may request that we update, correct or delete any feedback that you have provided to us by emailing us at privacy@mapbox.com, however we may have deleted or anonymized the feedback you had previously provided to us in a way that makes it infeasible for us to associate a particular piece of feedback with a particular user.
Your rights under the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)

California consumers have the following rights:

to not receive discriminatory treatment by Mapbox for the exercise of privacy rights conferred by the CCPA;
to request to know the personal information Mapbox has about you. You may access personal information associated with your Mapbox account, such as username, email address, and associated account activity by logging into your Mapbox account. If you do not have a Mapbox account, it will not be possible for Mapbox to verify your identity to a reasonably high degree of certainty to permit disclosure of specific pieces of information, as Mapbox only has limited personal information about non-accountholders; and
to request deletion of their personal information collected or maintained by Mapbox.
In order to submit a verifiable consumer request to delete your information, you must do the following:

If you have a Mapbox account, login to your Mapbox account, go to Settings, and click “Delete account” and follow the instructions. Mapbox uses your request while you are logged in to verify that you are the account holder. If you do not login to your Mapbox account to make this request, information associated with your Mapbox account will not be deleted.
You may, without logging into your Mapbox account, request deletion of your email address and associated personal information (if any) through this form. Mapbox will email you a confirmation link at the email you provide in order to verify the request. You must click on this confirmation link in the verification email Mapbox sends you to verify the email belongs to you before Mapbox can process your request. A request through this form will only request to delete personal information from non-account-related sources (such as the list of emails we send newsletters to). To delete account-related information, you must login to your Mapbox account to verify your identity.
If you believe Mapbox has any personal information about you that is not account-related and not an email address and associated information, please email Mapbox at privacy@mapbox.com describing in detail the information you believe Mapbox has and how you believe Mapbox obtained it. Please note that without an email address, it may not be possible for Mapbox to verify your identity to a reasonable degree of certainty to locate or delete any information.
Alternatively, you may call 1 (833) 732-4082 and leave a voicemail requesting deletion of personal information. In your voicemail, leave your email address, if you have one. You must still complete the verification steps described above in order for Mapbox to verify your identity.
It is our firm belief that we do not and will not “sell” your personal information. Nonetheless, if you don’t agree with our opinion, you are welcome to complete this form and you will be opted out of disclosure to third parties that are not our service providers. (If you also want to opt out of third-party cookies on our website, you can do so using your browser’s cookie preferences. More information is available here.)

Law Enforcement and Transparency
In General: Although we acknowledge that government sometimes must act to protect citizens' safety and security, we strongly believe that current laws regulating surveillance of individuals and access to user information need to be reformed. We have signed the Stop Watching Us petition and supports the principles of the Reform Government Surveillance open letter to Congress.

We post anonymized information about all law enforcement requests in our transparency report. Mapbox has never received a national security letter, FISA court order, or any other classified request for user information. If we ever receive such a request, we will review it carefully and make sure it follows the law (including the Fourth Amendment). If we believe a request is overly broad, we will seek to narrow it.

If we have a good faith belief that there is an emergency involving the danger of death or severe physical injury, we may disclose limited information necessary to prevent that harm.

Account Information, Hosted Data, Store Data and Payment Information: We require a subpoena or court order to provide information about your account, such as the name associated with the account, means of payment, and length of service. If we are ever forced to share identifiable information about you, we'll notify you with the full details of the request before we disclose it unless we are legally prohibited from doing so by law or court order.
Website Logs, Cookies, APIs and Mobile SDKs: We will only disclose information collected through our Services, including maps and associated data and location information, in response to a subpoena or court order.
U.S.-EU Privacy Shield and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
We (Mapbox, Inc. and Mapbox International, Inc.) comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. We continue to comply with ongoing Privacy Shield obligations with respect to personal information transferred to us from the European Economic Area in reliance on the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework prior to 16 July 2020 (“Historic Transfers”). The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework continues to be administered by the Department of Commerce and our commitments remain subject to the enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission. We have certified to the Department of Commerce that we adhere to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us using the information in the "Contact Us" section below. We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. Mapbox is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
If we shared personal data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing in violation of the U.S. Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
If you wish to transfer data to us under the Standard Contractual Clauses, please see our DPA.

4
Mapbox Rev. 07/2020
DocuSign Envelope ID: D732375D-10BA-46A7-9DB3-1C6431E0BA2A
shall maintain a current list of its sub-processors with respect to Customer Data, access to which can be
provided to Customer, and which information shall be held by Customer as strictly confidential and
only used to enforce its rights under this Section 5. Customer may object to changes concerning the
engagement or replacement of a sub-processor but only on reasonable and documented grounds
relating to the protection of Customer Data. Such an objection must be given by notifying Mapbox
promptly in writing, within 5 business days after Mapbox updates its sub-processor list, explaining
reasonable grounds for the objection. In the event Customer objects to a new sub-processor, as
permitted in the preceding sentence, Mapbox shall have the right to make available to Customer a
change in the Services or recommend a commercially reasonable change to Customer’s configuration
or use of the Services to avoid processing of personal data by the objected-to new sub-processor. If
Mapbox is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not
exceed ninety (90) days (the “Cure Period”), either party may terminate without penalty by either
party that part of the Services which cannot be provided by Mapbox without the use of the objected-to
new sub-processor by providing written notice to the other party within 5 business days after the end of
the Cure Period.
6. Post-termination Obligations
During the term of the Agreement, Customer can use the functionality provided to access and
download uploaded data. Upon expiration or termination of Customer’s relationship with Mapbox,
Mapbox will delete all Customer Data in accordance with its standard deletion policy unless applicable
EU, Member State or local law prevents it from destroying all or part of Customer Data. In such case,
Mapbox agrees to preserve the confidentiality of Customer Data retained by it and that it will only
actively process such Customer Data after such date in order to comply with the laws it is subject to.
7. International Data Transfers
The terms of this DPA incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses. For transfers of personal data
under this DPA from the European Union, the European Economic Area and/or their member states,
the United Kingdom and Switzerland to countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data
protection within the meaning of Applicable Data Protection Laws of the foregoing territories, the
Standard Contractual Clauses apply, subject to Schedule A.
In such case, (i) Customer is the “data exporter”; (ii) Mapbox is the “data importer”; (iii) the Standard
Contractual Clauses shall be governed by the law of the place where the data exporter is based; (iv) the
details of data processing for Appendix 1 of the Standard Contractual Clauses are as described in
Schedule B of the DPA; and (v) the technical and organizational security measures for Appendix 2 of

Terms of service
Welcome to the future of mapping! We're glad you're here.

This website, www.mapbox.com (the "site"), is owned and operated by Mapbox, Inc. and our affiliates ("Mapbox", "we" or “us”). By using the site, services provided on the site, our proprietary software made available to you via the site, or map content we make available to you through the services (collectively, "Services"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

Signing up
In order to use most Services, you must register for or authenticate into a Mapbox account. When you use our application program interfaces (APIs), including our SDK Registry/Downloads API, each request to an API must include one of your account's unique API keys.
Please carefully guard the security of your account and monitor use of your API keys. You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account, whether or not authorized, including any use of your API keys. At our discretion, we may make limited exceptions to this policy for unauthorized use of your account if you notify us of the problem promptly.
You must be 13 years or older to use the Services. By registering as a user or providing personal information on the site, you represent that you are at least 13 years old.
If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will mean the entity you represent.
If you are a United States government user or otherwise accessing or using any Mapbox service in a U.S. government capacity, these Terms are amended as set out in our U.S. Government Terms of Service.
Our services
Subject to these Terms and our Service Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to: (i) use the Services to develop online services and online, desktop, or mobile applications; (ii) make the Services available to end users in connection with their use of your online services and online, desktop, or mobile applications.
Contact us if you are looking to use enterprise-only products and services or to obtain additional volume-based discounts.
We may choose to make available to you products and services that are in beta, being provided for internal evaluation or trial, or otherwise not generally available (“Evaluation Products”). By accessing such Evaluation Products, you agree to only use them for internal evaluation or testing purposes. Upon our written request, you shall immediately cease all use, and destroy all copies, of Evaluation Products, and you shall provide us with written certification of such deletion.
Studio
If you use the places search function provided in the Studio dataset editor to place point features on a map, you must (1) only use such features internally, (2) not resell, sublicense or share such points with any third party, and (3) only use such points in compliance with the Geocoding API terms set forth above.
Boundaries Evaluation
In the event we give you access to our administrative level polygon vector tiles (“Boundaries"), you shall:
only use Boundaries in conjunction with a Mapbox Map for the sole purpose of internally evaluating whether to license Boundaries from us under an enterprise agreement;
not (and shall not permit any third party to) trace or otherwise derive or extract content, data and/or information from Boundaries;
not copy, disassemble, reverse engineer (except to the limited extent such restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of Boundaries; and
not use Boundaries to test, validate or benchmark against any other product, service or dataset without our prior written consent (a “Permitted Benchmarking”); if there is a Permitted Benchmarking, you shall provide us with a summary of the results, which we may use free-of-charge and without restriction to improve our products and services.
We may terminate your access to Boundaries at any time. Upon the termination of your access to Boundaries, you shall immediately cease all use, and destroy all copies, of Boundaries. Upon our written request, you shall provide us with written certification of deletion in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.
End users and notification
You may not allow your end users or other third parties to use the Services in any way that would be a violation of these Terms if done by you, and you agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use. You agree to promptly notify Mapbox in writing if you become aware of any misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Services.
Documentation
In addition to the requirements above, you agree to adhere to the policies posted on this site in conjunction with the Services, including accompanying documentation. Those policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms.
Charges and payment
You agree to pay all fees owed for your use of the Services, as calculated by our records based on our publicly available pricing, currently located at www.mapbox.com/pricing. All charges are non-refundable unless expressly prohibited by applicable law. We may charge your credit card on an recurring basis for any amounts that you owe us, some of which may require advance payments.
You acknowledge and agree that failure to use the current version of Mapbox Software may result in potentially different (and higher) fees being charged to you, and agree to pay any such fees as calculated by us.
Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full. You will be responsible for all reasonable expenses (including attorneys’ fees) incurred by us in collecting such delinquent amounts.
We are not responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Mapbox. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card.
Our listed fees do not include taxes, and you agree to pay all sales/use, gross receipts, value-added, GST, personal property or other tax (including any interest and penalties) with respect to the transactions and payments under these Terms, other than taxes based on our net income, employees or real property. You agree to work with us to help us obtain any necessary withholding or royalty tax exemptions where applicable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all payments made by you to us under these Terms will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as may be required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including but not limited to cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us after such deduction or withholding, will be equal to the full amount that we would have received if no deduction or withholding had been required. The payment of any taxes, charges or fees required to be deducted or withheld from payments due to us, and the filing of any information or tax returns with respect thereto, shall be your responsibility. Upon your reasonable request, we will provide you with any existing tax forms in our possession that would reduce or eliminate the amount of any such withholding or deduction for taxes.

But if you prefer we not use your logo or name in a particular way, just let us know, and we will respect that.
Account cancellation or suspension
We don't want you to leave, but you may cancel at any time. However, we do not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if you cancel during the middle of a billing cycle.
If you breach any of these Terms, we may immediately without notice cancel or suspend your account and the limited license granted to you hereunder automatically terminates, without notice to you. Upon termination of the limited license, you agree to immediately destroy any materials downloaded from the Services. In addition, Mapbox may cancel or suspend your account for any reason by providing you 30 days' advance notice.

Changes to services or terms
We may modify these Terms and other terms related to your use of the Services (like our privacy policy) from time to time, by posting the changed terms on the site. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the site unless they specify a later date. Changes will not apply retroactively. Please check these Terms periodically for changes - your continued use of the Services after new terms become effective constitutes your binding acceptance of the new terms.
We may change the features and functions of the Services, including APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you make to the Services are compatible with our then-current APIs. We attempt to avoid changes to our APIs that are not backwards compatible, but such changes may occasionally be required.

Upon written notice to you, we may (or may appoint appoint a nationally recognized certified public accountant or independent auditor to) audit your use of the Services and Mapbox Software to ensure it is in compliance with these Terms.
