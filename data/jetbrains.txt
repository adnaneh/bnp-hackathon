Why We Collect Data and What We Collect
We collect data for various reasons, such as:

a) To provide you with software, services, or information. We may collect data which are required to provide you with the software, support, and services, including checking for license validation and updates, provision of support, reporting of issues and bugs, and other processing connected with the use of JetBrains software, services, or information. We may use collected data in our development and testing of products and services. You explicitly fill in the data required for you to receive the software, support, or services, whether you purchase or use JetBrains Products, use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains Account, register for a webinar, participate in a survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing and/or technical information and content, or these data are collected in the course of use of JetBrains Products. We may use third-party service providers, acting as data processors, to assist us in providing JetBrains Products to you or in our operations. For example, we may use third-party service providers to provide data storage and backup services. With your consent, your Personal data may also be transferred to third-party service providers, acting as separate data controllers, who provide products and services complementary to JetBrains Products (further data processing performed by these service providers is governed by their privacy policies). The legal basis for this data processing is performance of contract between you and us.

b) To protect us from piracy and unlawful use of our software or services. We may collect data which are required to protect us from any piracy, unlawful, or unauthorized use of our software or services, or which are necessary to ensure the security of our software or services, including both data provided by you (see above) and data collected in the course of use of JetBrains Products. The legal basis for this data processing is JetBrains' legitimate interest in protection from piracy and unlawful use of JetBrains software and services.

c) To improve our offerings based on usage. We may collect data based on your use of JetBrains Products and services, and we do not associate these data with your name. We use these data to better understand the usage patterns of our products and the behaviors of our collective audience. At times we may share this information in aggregated anonymous form with third parties. Collection of data based on your use of JetBrains Downloadable Software Products is done only if you permit it. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in improving our software and services.

d) For internal evidence of JetBrains and to protect the rights and interests of JetBrains and other users. We may collect data which are required to keep evidence of provision of software and services to you, of any communication between you and us, of your contact details, of your use of our software and services, of any payments or refunds, and of any issues or disputes between you and us. We may use and disclose these data where we believe, in our sole judgment, that it is legitimate and appropriate to do so to protect our rights and interests and the rights and interests of other users of JetBrains Products or services, or where we believe there has been a violation of this Privacy Policy that could affect the interests of JetBrains or its customers. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in keeping internal evidence and protecting the rights and interests of us and other users.

e) To promote and market our products and services. We may use feedback that you provide voluntarily on our products or services. As permitted by applicable law, we may use this in the form of quotes or in other ways in accordance with the JetBrains Terms of Use. We also may use data that we collect and aggregate to assist us in determining appropriate marketing and advertising for our products and services. In doing so, we may share anonymous aggregated data with third parties to assist us with these efforts. With your consent or if permitted by applicable law, we may also use your contact details to send you commercial communications about our products and services. We also may use third-party service providers to assist us with our email marketing; in that case, the third-party service provider will have access to your email address, your name, and other information necessary to engage in the marketing. Such third-party service provider will act as a data processor and will not use your data for any other purpose. The legal basis for this data processing is our legitimate interest in promoting and marketing our products and services.

f) To fulfil legal duties stipulated by accounting, taxation, and other laws. We may use and disclose your personal data where required by law, such as in keeping and disclosing our accounts, in keeping and disclosing our tax records, and in response to a court order, valid subpoena, or other legal process. The legal basis for this data processing is our compliance with our legal obligations.

Clause 1
Processing
1.1 JetBrains provides certain products and services (“Products”) to Customer. Customer is either 1) the
sole Controller of Customer’s Personal Data or 2) has been instructed by and obtained authorization
from the relevant Controller(s) or Processor(s) to agree to the Processing of Customer’s Personal Data
by JetBrains as set out in this DPA. Customer hereby appoints JetBrains as a Processor, if Customer
acts as a Controller, or as a Subprocessor, if Customer acts as a Processor, to Process Customer’s
Personal Data. If there are other Controllers, Customer will identify them and inform JetBrains of any
such other Controllers prior to providing the Customer’s Personal Data, as set out in the DPA Exhibit.
1.2 JetBrains shall Process types of Customer’s Personal Data that Customer transfers to JetBrains by
entering it into Products, JetBrains Account, Personal Data types listed in the Agreements and/or the
Privacy Policy, and any other Customer’s Personal Data related to the Data Subjects. This Personal
Data shall concern Data Subjects, including end-users of JetBrains Products and
customers/employees of Customer. Processing will take place for the term of the Agreements and/or
this DPA, whichever is shorter. The nature, purpose, and subject matter of the Processing is aiming to
provide the Data Subject with the JetBrains products and services described in the applicable
Agreement, and if applicable described by Customer’s and its authorized Users’ choices in personal
data processing consent options.

the Exhibits hereto, and if applicable as described by Customer’s and its authorized Users’ use and
configuration of the features of the Product.

respect of the Products applicable to Customer. JetBrains is not responsible for determining the
requirements of laws applicable to Customer’s business or whether JetBrains’ provision of the
products meets the requirements of such laws. As between the parties, Customer is responsible for the
lawfulness of the Processing of Customer’s Personal Data. Customer will not use Products in
3
conjunction with Personal Data to the extent that doing so would violate applicable Data Protection
Laws.
1.5 JetBrains Processes Customer’s Personal Data, including transfers of Customer’s Personal Data to a
third country or an international organization, only upon documented instructions from Customer,
unless required to do so by law to which JetBrains is subject; in such case, JetBrains shall inform
Customer of that legal requirement before Processing, unless that law prohibits such communication
on important grounds relating to public interest.
1.6 Taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to JetBrains, JetBrains
will assist Customer in ensuring compliance with the obligations regarding ensuring the appropriate
level of security of Processing, notification of any Personal Data Breach to the Supervisory Authority,
communication of any Personal Data Breach to the Data Subject, and performing a Data Protection
Impact Assessment and Prior Consultations. Any such assistance will be provided in accordance with
clause 10.2 hereof.
Clause 2
Technical and organizational measures
2.1 JetBrains will implement and maintain the technical and organizational measures set forth in
Exhibit 2 hereto to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk relating to JetBrains’ scope of

reserves the right to modify Exhibit 2, provided that the functionality and security of Customer’s
Personal Data are not degraded.

protection for Customer’s Personal Data, taking into account the risks associated with the
Processing of Customer’s Personal Data.

responsible for responding to such requests from Data Subjects. JetBrains will assist Customer by
using appropriate technical and organizational measures (taking into account the nature of the
Processing) when responding to such Data Subject requests in accordance with clause 10.2.
3.2 If a Data Subject brings a claim directly against JetBrains for a violation of their Data Subject
rights related to JetBrains’ role as Customer’s Personal Data Processor or Subprocessor,
Customer will indemnify JetBrains for any cost, charges, damages, expenses, or loss arising from
such a claim, provided that JetBrains has notified Customer about the claim and given Customer
the opportunity to cooperate with JetBrains in the defense and settlement of the claim.
4
Clause 4
Third-Party Requests and Confidentiality
4.1 JetBrains will not disclose Customer’s Personal Data to any third party, unless authorized to do so
by Customer or required by law, save for JetBrains companies in accordance with the
Agreements.
4.2 JetBrains requires all of its personnel authorized to Process Customer’s Personal Data to commit
themselves to confidentiality, or ensures that they are under an appropriate statutory obligation of
confidentiality, and not to Process such Customer’s Personal Data for purposes other than as
described in this DPA, the Agreements and, if applicable, purposes described by Customer’s and
its authorized Users’ choices in personal data processing consent options.
Clause 5
Audit
5.1 JetBrains shall, in accordance with Data Protection Laws, make available to Customer such

to demonstrating JetBrains’ compliance with the obligations of Processors under Data Protection
Laws in relation to its Processing of Personal Data.

through: (a) JetBrains’ providing an audit report not older than eighteen (18) months, prepared by
an independent external auditor demonstrating that JetBrains’ technical and organizational
measures are sufficient and in accordance with the accepted industry audit standard and that
JetBrains complies with its obligations as Processor under Data Protection Laws (where possible
to hold this compliance proven by such audit); and b) JetBrains’ providing additional information
in JetBrains’ possession or control to an EU supervisory authority when it requests or requires
additional information in relation to the Processing of Personal Data carried out by JetBrains
under this DPA.
5.3 Each party will bear its own costs with respect to clauses 5.1 and 5.2 above. Any further
assistance will be provided in accordance with clause 10.2 hereof.

this DPA, unless otherwise required by applicable law.

Clause 7
Subprocessors

Personal Data (Subprocessors). A list of the current Subprocessors is set out on the respective
website available at https://www.jetbrains.com/legal/privacy/third-parties.html.
7.2 Notwithstanding the above, Customer hereby consents to JetBrains’ engaging other
Subprocessors than those listed on the respective website pursuant to clause 7.1., and/or replacing
those Subprocessors with new ones. For the avoidance of doubt, Customer grants JetBrains
general consent to engage Subprocessors. If Customer acts as a Processor, Customer confirms
that the Controller has consented to JetBrains engaging other Subprocessors, as provided above in
this clause 7.2.
7.3 If JetBrains decides to engage a not-listed Subprocessor according to clause 7.2 above, JetBrains
shall inform Customer about any and all upcoming changes regarding Subprocessors (engaging
new ones and/or replacing current ones) and will enable Customer to object to these changes. The
obligation to inform shall be deemed fulfilled by publishing the proposed changes on the
respective JetBrains website at least one (1) month before their effective date. If this method of
informing Customer is not feasible, JetBrains will inform Customer about the proposed change
via direct email. If Customer acts as a Processor, Customer undertakes to provide the information
about the engaging of non-listed Subprocessors to Controller.
Clause 8
Data Transfers
8.1 If (a) Customer is an EU-based Controller (or a Processor for an EU-based Controller), (b)
JetBrains is a Processor (or a Subprocessor), and (c) the conditions set forth under Article 3 of the
GDPR are met, and (d) only to the extent that any Processing of Personal Data by JetBrains takes
place in any country outside the EU (except if a country ensures an adequate level of protection
as defined in Article 45 of the GDPR), the parties agree that the standard contractual clauses
approved by the EU authorities under Data Protection Laws and set out in Exhibit 1 will apply in
respect of that Processing, JetBrains will comply with the obligations of the ‘data importer’ in the
standard contractual clauses, and Customer will comply with the obligations of the 'data exporter'.
8.2 If Customer is a Processor for an EU-based Controller and JetBrains is a Subprocessor, and the
conditions outlined in clause 8.1, items (c) and (d), are fulfilled, Customer is obliged to conclude
these standard contractual clauses with Controller, and the parties agree that Customer will
perform the duties of a Processor and JetBrains will perform the duties of a Subprocessor under
Exhibit 1.
8.3 For the avoidance of doubt, wherever this DPA links to its Exhibit 1, such link shall occur (and
the Exhibit 1 thus shall become a part of the DPA) only given that the conditions set forth in
clause 8.1 or 8.2 are fulfilled. In all other cases, Exhibit 1 shall not apply to this DPA.
8.4 Customer acknowledges and accepts that the provision of Products under the Agreement may
require the Processing of Personal Data by Subprocessors in countries outside the EU.
8.5 If, in the performance of this DPA, JetBrains transfers any Personal Data to a Subprocessor
located outside of the EU (without prejudice to clause 7), JetBrains shall in advance of any such
transfer ensure that a legal mechanism to achieve adequacy in respect of that Processing is in
place, such as: (a) the requirement that JetBrains execute or procure that the Subprocessor
6
execute to the benefit of Customer standard contractual clauses approved by the EU authorities
under Data Protection Laws and set out in Exhibit 1; (b) the requirement that the Subprocessor be
certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework; or (c) the existence of any other
specifically approved safeguard for data transfers (as recognized under Data Protection Laws)
and/or a European Commission finding of adequacy.
8.6 The following terms shall apply to the standard contractual clauses set out in Exhibit 1: (a)
Customer may exercise its right of audit under clause 5.1(f) of the standard contractual clauses as
set out in, and subject to the requirements of, clause 5.2 of this DPA; and (b) JetBrains may
appoint Subprocessors as set out, and subject to the requirements of, clause 7.
Clause 9
Personal Data Breach
9.1 JetBrains will notify Customer as soon as reasonably practicable in compliance with applicable
legislation after becoming aware of a Personal Data Breach with respect to Products. JetBrains
will promptly investigate the Personal Data Breach if it occurred on JetBrains infrastructure or in
another area JetBrains is responsible for, and will assist Customer as set out in Section 10.
Clause 10
Assistance
10.1 JetBrains will assist Customer by undertaking technical and organizational measures, insofar as
possible, to fulfill of Customer’s obligation to comply with the rights of Data Subjects and to ensure
compliance with Customer’s obligations relating to the security of Processing, the notification of a
Personal Data Breach and the Data Protection Impact Assessment, taking into account the information
available to JetBrains.

HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate
safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals
for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.
Clause 1
Definitions
For the purposes of the Clauses:
(a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data
subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data1
;
(b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;
1 Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within this Clause if they
considered it better for the contract to stand alone.
9
(c) 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal
data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and
the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate
protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;
(d) 'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor
of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor
of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out
on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of
the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;
(e) 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and
freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of
personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is
established;
(f) 'technical and organisational security measures' means those measures aimed at protecting
personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised
disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a
network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.
Clause 2
Details of the transfer
The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are
specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.
Clause 3
Third-party beneficiary clause
1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a)
to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party
beneficiary.
2. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g),
Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually
disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal
obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the
rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against
such entity.
3. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g),
Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the
data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless
any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by
operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in
which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the
subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
10
4. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the
data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.

and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their
implementation;
(e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;
(f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be

2 Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what
is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive
95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defence, public security,
the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the
regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject
or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples
of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society are, inter alia,
internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-laundering reporting
requirements.

Liability
1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the
obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to
receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against
the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their
obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually
disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data
subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any
successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by
operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid
its own liabilities.
3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to
in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred
to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually
disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data
subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations
under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity
has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by
operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability
of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
Clause 7
Mediation and jurisdiction

procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international
law.
Clause 8
Cooperation with supervisory authorities
1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so
requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.
2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer,
and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would
apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.
3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation
applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or
any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to

Clause 9
Governing Law
The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
Clause 10
Variation of the contract
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding
clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
Clause 11
Subprocessing
1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of
the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where
the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data
exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes
the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses3
.
Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement
the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the
subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
3 This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract entered into between the data
exporter and the data importer under this Decision.
14
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for
a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not
able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data
exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in
law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of
the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of
the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to in
paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is
established.
4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses and
notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The
list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.
Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services
1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data
importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data
transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and
certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer
prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case,
the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred
and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.
2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of
the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures
referred to in paragraph 1.

Orders can only be paid by wire transfer on net 30 days terms (payable within 30 days from the date Products are delivered), unless otherwise specified by JetBrains. Orders from newly registered corporate Customers and offline orders from individual Customers are subject to advance payment by wire transfer.

If purchase is subject to any Local Tax, it can be added to the invoice.

Also, JetBrains reserves the right to use any global service provider, including Taxamo Checkout Limited Ltd. as its commissionaire to invoice Customer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, JetBrains remains Customer’s counterparty and no other provisions of these Purchase Terms shall be affected.

If there is a possibility to issue the invoice without Local Tax, Customer is obliged to provide JetBrains with a valid Local Tax number (e.g. VAT ID) or valid exemption documentation.

Customer bears the sole responsibility for any withholding tax liabilities, and no deductions shall be made by Customer from the amount payable to JetBrains or Taxamo Checkout Limited Ltd. under any invoice.

Any correction to an invoice due to tax reasons (in particular based on the provision of Customer’s Local Tax number) shall be requested by Customer by the 7th day of the month following the month when the affected invoice was issued, at the latest.

TEMPORARY SUSPENSION FOR NON-PAYMENT
If Customer fails to pay any amount on time under these Purchase Terms and the applicable Terms of Use, JetBrains reserves the right to, at its sole discretion, suspend Customer’s access to all JetBrains’ Products and/or Plugins until such time as it is satisfied that all payments have been made or terminate the Terms of Use, in the manner specified in the applicable Terms of Use.

If JetBrains suspends Customer’s access to JetBrains’ Products and/or Plugins for any failure to, or delay in, payment of any amount, Customer must pay the entire outstanding amount in order to restore its access to JetBrains’ Products and/or Plugins. During any period of suspension, Customer hereby agrees that JetBrains is entitled to charge Customer for the entire period for which Customer has placed an order for subscription to JetBrains Products and/or Plugins.

REFUND AND SUPPORT
Any refund request following the Product or Plugin purchase date will be subject to prior authorization by JetBrains, and acceptance of such request shall be at the sole discretion of JetBrains, unless otherwise provided by applicable law.

In case a Product and/or Plugin shows any defects or does not function properly, Customer may contact JetBrains here:

Any Customer in the position of an Individual Consumer has the right to request that:

any defect is removed without undue delay free of charge;

The above Individual Consumer rights are applicable only in respect to any defects or malfunctions existing at the time of the Product and/or Plugin purchase, even if apparent later. Customer in the position of an Individual Consumer is entitled to assert his rights arising from a defect within twenty-four months from the purchase.

Downloaded, transferred, exported, or re-exported directly or indirectly in violation of Export Control Laws; or
