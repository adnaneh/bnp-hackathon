### DOCUMENT/ Privacy Policy / https://www.browserstack.com/privacy ###
Introduction.
Your privacy is of paramount importance to BrowserStack, Inc. BrowserStack, Inc. and its affiliates are referred to collectively in this policy as as “BrowserStack”, “we”, “us” or “our.” Our affiliates are:

BrowserStack Inc. in the United States.
BrowserStack Limited in Ireland.
BrowserStack Software Pvt. Ltd. in India.
Perceptual, Inc. in the United States.
BrowserStack provides a cloud-based service (the “Service”), which is an automated testing platform for testing websites and mobile apps. We fully respect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the Service and are committed to being transparent in our dealings with you as to what personal information we will collect and how we will use your personal information. Also, we only collect and use personal information that is necessary for providing Service and where we have a lawful basis to do so.

We have operations in India, Ireland and in the United States. The location of BrowserStack’s main establishment in the European Union is Ireland and therefore we consider our lead supervisory authority, for purposes of “one stop shop” oversight over our cross-border data processing, to be the Irish Data Protection Commissioner (“DPC”).

Our European Union representative for purpose of this Privacy Policy is:

We have created this Privacy Policy to describe our practices and procedures in handling “Personal Information” we collect or receive from you. The term “Personal Information” means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, to an identified or identifiable living natural person, including but not limited to: (i) Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, government identification card number, passport number, or other similar identifiers; and (ii) information defined as “personal information,” “personally identifiable information,” “personal data,” or similar expressions under applicable privacy laws or data security Laws, which include the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (”GDPR”).

This Privacy Policy covers two kinds of Personal Information: Account-Related Information and Personal Information collected by or in connection with the use of our website.

“Account-Related Information” means contact information, payment information, and biographical information about our customers’ representatives and contacts used for marketing, opening new user accounts to use BrowserStack’s Services, and to maintain existing accounts.
We collect various categories of Personal Information by or in connection with the use of our websites described in Section 3 below. Our websites include our main website, our visual testing service page and certain pages hosted by third parties on our behalf, such as pages to apply for jobs at BrowserStack.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. We will ask for your consent to be bound by this Privacy Policy as a condition of:

Allowing you to register for a BrowserStack account (an “Account”) on our website or any mobile application. Any users who use an Account will also be required to expressly accept this Privacy Policy before first accessing (or before continuing to access) our Service through Your Account. If you do not agree to these terms you must leave our website immediately, you must discontinue use of any use of our mobile application, and you will not be permitted to create an Account or use the Service. If you choose to accept this Privacy Policy, we will keep a record of your acceptance.
Submitting a web form to communicate with us or apply for a job on website pages we our vendors host on our behalf.
Please note that this Privacy Policy does not cover “Customer Content.” “Customer Content” means (i) data or content in a website or mobile application that a customer chooses to test (and for mobile applications, the application package itself); (ii) data a customer submits or creates as part of a test, including test scripts and screenshots; and (iii) any other data a customer submits to BrowserStack in connection with the use of the Services (not including Account-Related Information).

Customer Content does not fall within this Privacy Policy, because the Services are not designed for use with (and do not require) Personal Information included in Customer Content. In our agreements with customers, they specifically agree not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information.

Our website and Services are intended for use by adults. We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from users under 18 years of age.

Privacy Shield Disclosures.
BrowserStack complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union and the United Kingdom to the United States. BrowserStack has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the principles of the Privacy Shield Framework (“Privacy Shield Principles”). If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/.

BrowserStack’s commitments under the Privacy Shield Framework are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.

Section 14 below discusses information about the specific independent dispute resolution body that is available to address complaints about BrowserStack’s privacy practices and to provide appropriate recourse free of charge to individuals.

Types of Information We Collect.
You must register an Account in order to use the Service. The registration process asks for Account-Related Information: a full name, password, email address, IP address, zip code and last four digits of your credit card (and address and contact details, which are optional). When you are running tests on BrowserStack, we log additional information like browser used, your latency to remote VM, your plan information, integration used, local, performance numbers etc. When you log into the Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type and settings, browser language, the address of the web page visited before using the Service, the date and time the Service was used, information about browser configuration and plugins, language preferences and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. (See the discussion of cookies in Section 3.) The legal bases upon which we process Account-Related Information is fulfillment of our contract to provide the Service to you and your consent.

Our websites collect certain Personal Information about visitors. For instance, through the use of cookies (discussed in Section 4), we are able to collect and analyze data about the use of our websites. See Section 4 for more detail. Also, when you submit a web form to communicate with us, we collect your name, email address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the webform’s fields. When you apply for a job using a web page with a job listing, we collect your name, email address, phone number, postal address, and whatever Personal Information you include in the “cover letter” field you provide or the resume you upload. We ask for consent for the use of cookies, and we ask for your consent to this Privacy Policy when submitting a communication or job application web form as the legal basis for processing the Personal Information communicated to us.

When you send a web form, email, or other communication to BrowserStack (other than in respect of Personal Information included in support requests), we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Service. When you submit a job application to BrowserStack, we will process the Personal Information you provide to us in connection with your candidacy for the job for which you applied. BrowserStack is a “data controller” under applicable data protection law with respect to the Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy.

We may collect information from potential customers at trade shows or meetings, as well as information obtained by obtaining contact lists from marketing companies. The basis for receiving such information is the consent of the individual.

Note to California residents: BrowserStack does not currently have a mechanism to take action in response to a “do not track” signal or browser setting. There is no current standard way of handling such signals. If and when the industry creates standards for responding to them, BrowserStack will reappraise its handling of “do not track” signals.

When BrowserStack Will Disclose or Transfer Account-Related Information or Personal Information.
BrowserStack will not share Account-Related Information without your consent or unless required by law (except as described in this Privacy Policy) or as discussed below in this section. By the nature of our Service, and in connection with the collection of website analytics under Sections 3 and 4 above, BrowserStack will gather statistics about the usage of your website and store that information. BrowserStack will not share your website statistics without your consent. If BrowserStack becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some of all of its assets (including in a bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, or similar proceeding), you agree that we will be able to transfer Account-Related Information to any successor or transferee third party.

We may share with third parties certain pieces of aggregated, non-personal information such as the number of sites, devices accessed while using BrowserStack, for example. Such information does not identify you individually.

We restrict access to Personal Information to employees, contractors, agents, and subcontractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Service. These individuals and businesses are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, civil litigation, and/or criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Account-Related Information may be transferred to, stored at, or accessed from a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) for the purposes of us providing the Service. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us, another corporate entity within our group, or any of our suppliers. By submitting Account-Related Information, you explicitly consent to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that Account-Related Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. The safeguards in place with regard to the transfer of Account-Related Information outside of the EEA are the entry by us into appropriate contracts with all transferees of such data and/or assurance that the data importer is subject to a code of conduct or certification imposing reasonable and appropriate data protection safeguards.

All Account-Related Information you provide to us is stored on our (or contracted third party) secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access the Service, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with any person not authorized to use the Service.

Also, we may disclose Account-Related Information or other Personal Information when required by a subpoena, court order, search warrant, other legal process, lawful requests by law enforcement or other public agencies, or applicable law. These requests may include those pursuant to national security or law enforcement requirements. Moreover, we may disclose Account-Related Information or other Personal Information to the extent necessary to maintain the security of our websites, resolve disputes, or investigate possible misconduct.

We use third party service providers and their websites to collect certain Personal Information on our behalf, such as a payment services and a hosted job application site. We require our service providers to maintain appropriate administrative (organizational) and technical measures designed to protect the security and confidentiality of any Personal Information these service providers process on our behalf.

In the context of an onward transfer BrowserStack has responsibility for the processing of personal information it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. BrowserStack shall remain liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if its agent processes such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless the BrowserStack proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

Security of Account-Related Information and Other Personal Information.
We implement reasonable and appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect user privacy and protect Account-Related Information and other Personal Information. We restrict access to Account-Related Information and other Personal Information to employees, contractors, agents, and subcontractors that need to know such Personal Information in order to operate, develop or improve the Services that we provide. When we outsource any processes, we require the service provider to have reasonable and appropriate security measures in place.
We will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Account-Related Information and other Personal Information we collect. In particular, we will consider the risks presented by accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to Account-Related Information and other Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will implement safeguards to protect Account-Related Information and other Personal Information we collect, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted us and any transmission of Account-Related Information is at your own risk. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use security procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorized access. You acknowledge that we cannot guarantee the absolute prevention of cyber-attacks such as hacking, spyware and viruses.

We will notify serious data breaches in respect of Account-Related Information or other Personal Information as required by law without undue delay, A Personal Information breach in this context means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, Personal Information transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.

Right of Access and Data Integrity.
You may ask to see what Personal Information we hold about you and be provided with:

a summary of such Personal Information and the categories of Personal Information held (see Sections 3 and 5 above);
details of the purpose for which it is being or is to be processed (see Section 5 above);
details of the recipients or classes of recipients to whom it is or may be disclosed, including if they are overseas and what protections are used for those oversea transfers (see Section 7 above);
details of the period for which it is held or the criteria we use to determine how long it is held (see Section 12 below);
details of your rights, including the rights to rectification, erasure, restriction or objection to the processing (set out in this Section 5);
any information available about the source of that data (see Section 1 above);
whether we carry out automated decision-making, or profiling, and where we do, information about the logic involved and the envisaged outcome or consequences of that decision making or profiling, although we do not currently carry out any profiling or use automated decision-making; and
where your Personal Information are transferred out of the EEA, what safeguards are in place (see Section 7 below).
Details in respect of the above points are all set out in this Privacy Policy; however, if you need further clarification, please contact us (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below).

Requests for your Personal Information must be made to us (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below) specifying what Personal Information you need access to, and a copy of such request may be kept by us for our legitimate purposes in managing the Service. To help us find the information easily, please give us as much information as possible about the type of information you would like to see. If, to comply with your request, we would have to disclose information relating to or identifying another person, we may need to obtain the consent of that person, if possible. If we cannot obtain consent, we may need to withhold that information or edit the data to remove the identity of that person, if possible.

There are certain types of data which we are not obliged to disclose to you, which include Personal Information which records our intentions in relation to any negotiations with you where disclosure would be likely to prejudice those negotiations. We are also entitled to refuse a data access request from you where (i) such request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character (in this case, if we decide to provide you with the Personal Information requested, we may charge you a reasonable fee to account for administrative costs of doing so), or (ii) we are entitled to do so pursuant to data protection law.

You can require us to correct any mistakes in your Personal Information which we hold free of charge. If you would like to do this, please:

email or write to us (see ‘How can you contact us’ below);
let us have enough information to identify you (e.g. name, registration details); and
let us know the information that is incorrect and what it should be replaced with.
If we are required to update your Personal Information, we will inform recipients to whom that Personal Information have been disclosed (if any), unless this proves impossible or has a disproportionate effort.

It is your responsibility that all of the Personal Information provided to us is accurate and complete. If any information you have given us changes, please let us know as soon as possible (see ‘How To Contact Us’ below).

Purpose Limitation.
Except as stated in other provisions of this Privacy Policy, we process only that Account-Related Information needed for the purpose of providing, improving, and ensuring the delivery of the Service as consented to by you or in accordance with your instructions. We process Personal Information for job applications only in connection with the processing of your application. We process other Personal Information only as described in Section 5. If we intend to process Personal Information for other purposes or in a manner incompatible with the purposes for which it has been collected or authorized by a data subject, we will obtain your consent before such processing occurs.

Retention of Account-Related Information and Other Personal Information Content.
Account-Related Information other Personal Information will be kept and stored for such period of time as we deem necessary taking into account the business purpose for which it was collected in the first instance (i.e. the administration of Your Account for as long as Your Account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate Your Account), and our obligations under applicable data protection law. This may include retaining Account-Related Information or other Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services.

Where we retain Personal Information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Service, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.

Individual Rights of Individuals within California, U.S.A.

Sale of Personal Information
BrowserStack does not sell personal information in its possession and has not done so in the preceding 12 months
Policy Against Discrimination
BrowserStack’s customers are almost entirely businesses, as opposed to individual sole proprietors. Therefore, BrowserStack is unlikely to transact business with individual California residents. Nonetheless, BrowserStack will not discriminate against individual California residents for exercising any of their rights under the CCPA, including by:
Denying goods or services to the California resident
Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties.
Providing a different level or quality of goods or services
Suggesting that the California resident will receive a different price or rate for goods or services or a different level or quality of goods or services
Notice to California Residents About “Do Not Track Settings”.
Under California law, online service providers must say in their privacy policies how they respond to “do not track” settings that users can set in their browser software. Currently, there is no standard governing what, if anything, a website operator should do when receiving a “do not track” signal. Accordingly, BrowserStack does not currently take action in response to a “do not track” browser setting. BrowserStack will revisit this policy accordingly if an industry standard regarding such settings emerges.

Amendments to this Privacy Policy.
BrowserStack may change its Privacy Policy from time to time and at BrowserStack’s sole discretion. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page. If you do not agree to these changes, please do not continue to use the Service to submit Account-Related Information or other Personal Information to us. If material changes are made to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by placing a prominent notice on our website or by sending you a notification in relation to this. We will not process Account-Related Information in a manner not contemplated by this Privacy Policy without your consent.

How to Contact Us.
If you need to contact us with regard to any of your rights as set out in this Policy, all such requests should be made in writing by email to compliance@browserstack.com.

Recourse and Resolving Disputes or Complaints.
If you do not think that we have processed your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please contact us in the first instance. You may submit a complaint to us at the contact information in Section 13.

Also, in compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, BrowserStack commits to resolve complaints about the collection or processing of Personal Information of residents of the European Economic Area. Individual residents of the European Economic Area with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield policy should first contact us at the contact information in Section 13.

Once we receive a privacy complaint, our privacy team will investigate your complaint and give you a response. We will need sufficient information from you for us to evaluate your complaint and, as a result, we may request that you give us additional information that we believe is necessary to assess your complaint.

BrowserStack has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.

Dispute resolution proceedings will be in English.

If the informal discussions with BrowserStack and the formal dispute resolution process described above fail to resolve your complaint, you may be entitled to engage in binding arbitration with BrowserStack through the Privacy Shield Panel, which is the ICDR/AAA Privacy Shield Program, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. Please contact or visit https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html for more information or to file a complaint.

If you are not satisfied with the results of these dispute resolution mechanisms, you can complain to the DPC or exercise any of your other rights pursuant to applicable data protection law.

BROWSERSTACK SERVICES
Access to Services. Customer will purchase and BrowserStack will provide the specific Services as specified in the applicable Order Form.

As part of its use of the Services and if required, Customer may copy and use the Documentation for Customer’s internal use in connection with the use of the Services.
Permitted Users
In General. Use of and access to the Services is permitted by and only by the number of employees of Customer specified in the applicable Order Form (“Permitted Users”). If Customer is given passwords to access the Services on BrowserStack’s systems, Customer will require that all Permitted Users keep user ID and password information strictly confidential and not share such information with any unauthorized person.

Contractors and Affiliates. Customer may permit individuals serving as its independent contractors and consultants who are not competitors of BrowserStack (“Contractors”) and individual employees, contractors, or consultants of Affiliates (as defined below) to serve as Permitted Users, provided Customer remains responsible for compliance by each such Contractor or Affiliate Permitted User with all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and any such use of the Services by such Contractor or Affiliate Permitted User is for the sole benefit of Customer.

If Customer receives free access or a trial or evaluation subscription to one or more Services (a “Trial Subscription”), then Customer may use the Services in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement for a period of thirty (30) days or such other period granted by BrowserStack (the “Trial Period”). Trial Subscriptions are permitted solely for Customer’s use to determine whether to purchase a paid subscription to the Services. Certain Trial Subscriptions may include pre-release and beta products (“Beta Releases”). Trial Subscriptions may not include all functionality and features accessible as part of a paid Subscription. If Customer does not enter into a paid Subscription Term, this Agreement and Customer’s right to access and use the Services will terminate at the end of the Trial Period. BrowserStack has the right to terminate a Trial Subscription at any time for any reason. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, BROWSERSTACK WILL HAVE NO WARRANTY, INDEMNITY, DATA ARCHIVING, SERVICE LEVEL, OR SUPPORT OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO TRIAL SUBSCRIPTIONS.
CUSTOMER CONTENT
Rights in Customer Content. As between the parties, Customer will retain all right, title and interest (including any and all intellectual property rights) that Customer may have in and to the Customer Content as submitted to or accessed through the Services. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer hereby grants to BrowserStack a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right to use, copy, store, transmit, modify, create derivative works of and display the Customer Content solely to the extent necessary to provide the Services to Customer. For clarity, BrowserStack tests Customer Properties, but does not operate the live Customer Properties run by Customer.
Storage by BrowserStack. Upon termination of a test, the Test Environment will be deleted (or, for physical, non-emulated devices, reset to factory settings). As a result, any Customer Content resident in a Test Environment will be deleted after completion of the test. Notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Customer Content is stored by BrowserStack as follows:
BrowserStack will retain any Screenshots and output (such as reports or log data) created using the Services to allow Customer to access the Screenshots and output for later use by Customer.
If Customer uploads a mobile application for use with the Services, BrowserStack will retain a copy of that application for use by Customer in subsequent tests.
BrowserStack may retain short-term technical backups as part of providing the Services.
BrowserStack will also retain Screenshots along with the captured DOM and associated assets (CSS,
images, javascript etc.) used to render the Screenshot in case of its visual testing Service.
Any Customer Content will be retained subject to BrowserStack’s data retention policies and confidentiality obligations under this Agreement. Except as set forth above, the Services do not provide a solution for storage of Customer Content or backups. Customer agrees that Customer Content shall include only copies of Customer’s data, and not any data that Customer needs for backup or archival purpose.

Customer Obligations.
In General. Customer will ensure that Customer’s use of each Service and all Customer Content is at all times compliant with Customer’s privacy policies and all applicable local, state, federal and international laws, regulations and conventions, including, without limitation, those related to data privacy and data transfer, international communications, and the exportation of technical or personal data. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, content and legality of all Customer Content. Customer represents and warrants to BrowserStack that Customer has all necessary rights, consents and permissions to collect, share and use all Customer Content as contemplated in this Agreement (including granting BrowserStack the rights in Section 3.1), and that no Customer Content will violate or infringe (i) any third party intellectual property, publicity, privacy or other rights or (ii) any Laws. If specified in the Documentation, Customer will submit certain types of Customer Content (e.g., mobile applications) in the format required by BrowserStack.
No Personal Information. Customer acknowledges that the Services are not designed for use with (and do not require) Personal Information included in Customer Content. Customer specifically agrees not to use the Services to collect, store, process or transmit any Personal Information other than Account-Related Information, and will not submit to the Services any Customer Content containing any Personal Information. BrowserStack will have no liability under this Agreement for Personal Information included within Customer Content, or any security incident or breach regarding such Personal Information, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein.
Customer Content Guidelines. Customer will not use the Services with any Customer Content that (i) is deceptive, fraudulent, illegal, obscene, defamatory, libelous, threatening, harmful to minors, pornographic, indecent, harassing, hateful, religiously, racially or ethnically offensive, that encourages illegal or tortious conduct or that is otherwise inappropriate in BrowserStack’s discretion; (ii) contains viruses, bots, worms, scripting exploits or other similar materials; or (iii) could otherwise cause damage to BrowserStack or any third party.
Indemnification by Customer. Customer will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BrowserStack from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, losses, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs) arising out of or in connection with any claim arising from or relating to (a) any Customer Content or acts or omissions of Customer that constitute a breach or alleged breach by Customer of Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) or (b) any service or product offered by Customer in connection with or related to the Services. This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving (i) prompt written notice of such claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for Customer to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation, defense, or settlement of such claim; and (iii) all necessary cooperation of BrowserStack at Customer’s expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, BrowserStack may participate in the defense of any claim by counsel of its own choosing, at its cost and expense and Customer will not settle any claim without BrowserStack’s prior written consent, unless the settlement fully and unconditionally releases BrowserStack and does not require BrowserStack to pay any amount, take any action, or admit any liability.
DATA PROTECTION.
In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), the data protection terms relating to processing of Account-Related Information and Customer Content are contained in Exhibit A (Data Protection Addendum). To the extent that there is any conflict between any provision of the Agreement and the contents of Exhibit A, the contents of Exhibit A shall prevail in respect of such conflict in so far as the matters of data protection are concerned.

REGULATORY COMPLIANCE.
Browserstack is currently in compliance with and shall at all times remain in compliance with the regulations of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the Department of the Treasury and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto. In accordance with the regulations, BrowserStack does not offer services to users in specific sanctioned regions and hence does not allow users in such regions to access all of certain parts of the website, including certain products. More information about the sanctions programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) of the US Department of the Treasury is available at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/pages/default.aspx. Therefore, Customer and/or its Affiliates agree that they are not from such specific sanctioned regions and are currently in compliance with and will at all times during the Subscription Term of this Agreement remain in compliance with the regulations of OFAC and any statute, executive order, or other governmental action relating thereto.

OWNERSHIP.
BrowserStack Technology. This is a subscription agreement for access to and use of the Services. Customer acknowledges that it is obtaining only a limited right to the Services and that irrespective of any use of the words “purchase”, “sale” or like terms in this Agreement no ownership rights are being conveyed to Customer under this Agreement. Customer agrees that BrowserStack or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to the Services, all Documentation, Professional Services deliverables and any and all related and underlying technology and documentation and any derivative works, modifications or improvements of any of the foregoing, including as may incorporate Feedback (collectively, “BrowserStack Technology”). Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no rights in any BrowserStack Technology are granted to Customer. Further, Customer acknowledges that the Services are offered as an on-line, hosted solution, and that Customer has no right to obtain a copy of any of the Services.
Feedback. Customer, from time to time, may submit comments, questions, suggestions or other feedback relating to any BrowserStack product or service to BrowserStack (“Feedback”). BrowserStack may freely use or exploit Feedback in connection with any of its products or services without the need to pay compensation for any use of such Feedback.
Usage Data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Customer agrees that BrowserStack may obtain technical data about Customer’s use of the Services that is non-personally identifiable with respect to Customer (“Usage Data”), and BrowserStack may use the Usage Data to analyze, improve, market, support and operate the Services and otherwise for any business purpose during and after the term of this Agreement. For clarity, this Section 6.3 does not give BrowserStack the right to identify Customer as the source of any Usage Data.
FEES & PAYMENT
Fees and Payment. All fees are as set forth in the applicable Order Form and are due within thirty (30) days from the date of invoice . All fees are non-cancellable and non-refundable. Customer is required to pay any sales, use, GST, value-added, withholding, or similar taxes or levies, whether domestic or foreign, other than taxes based on the income of BrowserStack. Customer must make all payments without any setoffs, withholdings, or deduction of any kind. Any late payments will be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum amount allowed by law, whichever is less.
BrowserStack may change the fees in effect or add new fees and charges from time to time. Furthermore, notwithstanding any other provision contained herein (but subject to any applicable law), at the time of any renewal of a subscription, Customer agrees that BrowserStack may increase Customer’s recurring fees up to the greater of (i) the then list price as publicly marketed on our website, or (ii) five percent (5%). BrowserStack may, in its sole discretion, offer Customer a grace-period in which their fees will not increase for a certain period of time. If Customer does not accept the increase or addition to the existing fees, Customer may elect to terminate its account during the then current billing period and Customer shall not be liable for such fee increase after the applicable billing period; however, any later renewal of service will be subject to the increased fee structure.
Suspension of Service. In addition to any of BrowserStack’s other rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), BrowserStack reserves the right to suspend Customer’s access to the Services if: (i) Customer’s account is thirty (30) days or more overdue; (ii) BrowserStack determines that Customer has breached Section 2.3 (General Restrictions) or Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations); or (iii) BrowserStack determines that suspension is necessary to prevent harm or liability to other customers or third parties, or to preserve the security, stability, availability or integrity of the Services. BrowserStack will have no liability for taking action as permitted above in this section. However, unless this Agreement has been terminated, BrowserStack will cooperate with Customer to restore access to the Services once it verifies that Customer has resolved the condition requiring suspension.
TERM AND TERMINATION
Term. This Agreement is effective as of the Effective Date. Either party may terminate this Agreement on written notice if there are no Order Forms in effect. Each Service is provided on a subscription basis for a set term designated on the Order Form and thereafter, will automatically renew for successive terms of equal length to the initial term unless either party provides the other party with written notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term (the initial term and each renewal term, a “Subscription Term”).
Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement (including all related Order Forms) if the other party (a) fails to cure any material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within thirty (30) days after written notice; (b) ceases operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors’ arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party (and not dismissed within sixty (60) days thereafter).
Effect of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, Customer will immediately cease any and all use of and access to all Services (including any and all related BrowserStack Technology) and delete (or, at BrowserStack’s request, return) any and all copies of the Documentation, any BrowserStack passwords or access codes and any other BrowserStack Confidential Information in its possession. Provided this Agreement was not terminated for Customer’s breach, Customer may retain and use internally copies of all reports exported from any Service prior to termination. Customer acknowledges that following termination it will have no further access to any Customer Content input into any Service, and that BrowserStack may delete any such data as may have been stored by BrowserStack at any time. Except where an exclusive remedy is specified, the exercise of either party of any remedy under this Agreement, including termination, will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.
Survival. The following Sections will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2.3 (General Restrictions), 2.4 (Trial Subscriptions), 3.2 (Storage by BrowserStack), 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer), 6 (Ownership), 7.1 (Fees and Payment), 8 (Term and Termination), 9.2 (Warranty Disclaimer), 11 (Confidential Information) and 12 (General Terms).
LIMITED WARRANTY
Limited Warranty. BrowserStack warrants, for Customer’s benefit only, that each Service will operate in substantial conformity with the applicable Documentation. BrowserStack’s sole liability (and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy) for any breach of this warranty will be, at no charge to Customer, for BrowserStack to use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the reported non-conformity, or if BrowserStack determines such remedy to be impracticable, either party may terminate the applicable Subscription Term and Customer will receive as its sole remedy a refund of any fees Customer has pre-paid for use of such Service for the terminated portion of the applicable Subscription Term. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 9.1 will not apply: (i) unless Customer makes a claim within thirty (30) days of the date on which Customer first noticed the non-conformity, (ii) if the error was caused by misuse, unauthorized modifications or third-party hardware, software or services, or (iii) to use provided based on a Trial Subscription.
Warranty Disclaimer. EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 9.1, ALL SERVICES AND THE BROWSERSTACK CODE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”. NEITHER BROWSERSTACK NOR ITS SUPPLIERS MAKES ANY OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGEMENT. BROWSERSTACK DOES NOT WARRANT THAT CUSTOMER’S USE OF ANY SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, NOR DOES BROWSERSTACK WARRANT THAT IT WILL REVIEW THE CUSTOMER CONTENT FOR ACCURACY OR THAT IT WILL PRESERVE OR MAINTAIN THE CUSTOMER CONTENT WITHOUT LOSS. BROWSERSTACK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DELAYS, INTERRUPTIONS, SERVICE FAILURES OR OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN USE OF THE INTERNET AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OR OTHER SYSTEMS OUTSIDE THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF BROWSERSTACK. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE OTHER STATUTORY RIGHTS, BUT THE DURATION OF STATUTORILY REQUIRED WARRANTIES, IF ANY, WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SHORTEST PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.
Specific Disclaimers. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, BROWSERSTACK IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DELAYS, DELIVERY FAILURES, OR ANY OTHER LOSS OR DAMAGE RESULTING FROM (I) THE TRANSFER OF DATA OVER PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS NETWORKS AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING THE INTERNET, OR (II) ANY DELAY OR DELIVERY FAILURE ON THE PART OF ANY OTHER SERVICE PROVIDER NOT CONTRACTED BY US, AND CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE SERVICE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE USE OF SUCH COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES. CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT BROWSERSTACK CANNOT GUARANTEE THE ABSOLUTE PREVENTION OF CYBER-ATTACKS SUCH AS HACKING, SPYWARE, AND VIRUSES. ACCORDINGLY, BROWSERSTACK SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE, LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF CUSTOMER DATA ARISING FROM SUCH RISKS AS LONG AS SUCH RISK CANNOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO NEGLIGANCE OR FAILURE ON BROWSERSTACK’S PART.
LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES
Consequential Damages Waiver. EXCEPT FOR EXCLUDED CLAIMS (DEFINED BELOW), NEITHER PARTY (NOR ITS SUPPLIERS) WILL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, THE DOCUMENTATION, OR THE BROWSERSTACK CODE FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF SECURITY MECHANISMS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, OR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, RELIANCE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE.
Liability Cap. BROWSERSTACK’S AND ITS SUPPLIERS’ ENTIRE LIABILITY TO CUSTOMER ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, THE DOCUMENTATION, OR THE BROWSERSTACK CODE AT ANY TIME WILL NOT EXCEED $1 UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
Excluded Claims. “Excluded Claims” means any claim arising (a) from Customer’s breach of Section 2.3 (General Restrictions); (b) under Section 3.3 (Customer Obligations) and Section 3.4 (Indemnification by Customer); or (c) from a party’s breach of its obligations in Section 11 (Confidential Information) (but excluding claims related to Customer Content).
Nature of Claims and Failure of Essential Purpose. The parties agree that the waivers and limitations specified in this Section 10 apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contact, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
Each party (as “Receiving Party”) agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party (“Disclosing Party”) constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party (“Confidential Information”), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any BrowserStack Technology, performance information relating to any Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement will be deemed Confidential Information of BrowserStack without any marking or further designation. Customer Content will be deemed Confidential Information of Customer without the need for any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know (including, for BrowserStack, its subcontractors), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 11 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by any such representative with the terms of this Section 11. The Receiving Party’s confidentiality obligations will not apply to information that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by administrative or judicial process, applicable law, or court order, provided the Receiving Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.

GENERAL TERMS

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the advance written consent of the other party, except that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with a merger, reorganization, acquisition or other transfer of all or substantially all of such party’s assets or voting securities.

In the event that there is any conflict between the Standard Contractual clauses and the other provisions of this Agreement, such Standard Contractual Clauses shall take precedence in respect of such conflict (other than in respect of legislative references etc. which have been updated pursuant to Data Protection Legislation since the date of approval of such Standard Contractual Clauses.)
Sub-processors
Customer agrees and acknowledges that BrowserStack may have Account-Related Information and Customer Content Processed by any of BrowserStack Affiliates and by any agents and contractors for the purpose of providing the Service (a “Sub-processor”). A current list of the categories of Sub-processors used by BrowserStack is maintained on BrowserStack’s website at https://www.browserstack.com/sub-processors. Customer specifically authorizes the engagement as Sub-processors of (a) those entities listed at the URL mentioned herein, and (b) all other BrowserStack Affiliates from time to time. Customer generally authorizes the engagement as Sub-processors of any other third parties. In case BrowserStack intends to add a new Sub-processor, BrowserStack shall update the website ten (10) days prior to authorizing any new Sub-processor to Process Account-Related Information and Customer Content in connection with the provision of the applicable Services.
Customer may reasonably object to BrowserStack’s use of a new Sub-processor by notifying BrowserStack promptly in writing within the ten (10) days after BrowserStack updates its website in accordance with the mechanism set out in Clause 11.1. In the event Customer objects to a new Sub-processor, as permitted in the preceding sentence, BrowserStack will use reasonable efforts to make available to Customer a change in the Services. If BrowserStack is unable to make available such change within a reasonable period of time, which shall not exceed thirty (30) days, Customer may terminate the applicable Order Form(s) by providing written notice to BrowserStack.
With respect to each Sub-processor, BrowserStack shall, before the Sub-processor first Processes Account-Related Information), ensure that the Sub-processor is capable of providing the level of protection for Account-Related Information required by this Exhibit.
BrowserStack will remain fully liable to Customer in respect of any failure by the Sub-processor to fulfil its data protection obligations regarding Account-Related Information.
If Customer has entered into the Standard Contract Clauses, the authorizations given by the Customer under this Section 11 shall constitute Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by BrowserStack of the processing of personal data.
Audit Rights
BrowserStack Audits: BrowserStack uses external auditors to verify the adequacy of its security measures. This audit: (a) will be performed at least annually; (b) will be performed according to relevant standards; (c) will be performed by independent third party security professionals at BrowserStack’s selection and expense; and (d) will result in the generation of System and Organization Controls (SOC) 2 Report (“Report”), which will be BrowserStack’s Confidential Information.
Audit Reports: At Customer’s written request, and provided that the parties have an applicable NDA in place, BrowserStack will provide Customer with a copy of the Report and other documents and information via questionnaires, so that Customer can reasonably verify BrowserStack’s compliance with its obligations under this DPA.
Customer agrees to exercise any right it may have to conduct an audit or inspection, under the Standard Contractual Clauses if they apply, by instructing BrowserStack to carry out the audit described in Section 12.1. If Customer wishes to change this instruction regarding the audit, then Customer has the right to request a change to this instruction by sending BrowserStack a written notice as provided for in the Agreement. If a written notice is sent by the Customer, including under the Standard Contract Clauses if they apply, BrowserStack will allow Customer or an independent auditor appointed by Customer to conduct audits once every five (5) years, if required by law and in accordance with this Section:
Customer must send a written request for audits to BrowserStack.
Following receipt by BrowserStack of such request, BrowserStack and Customer shall discuss and agree in advance on: (i) the reasonable date(s) of and security and confidentiality controls applicable to any review of the SOC 2 report; and (ii) the reasonable start date, scope and duration of and security and confidentiality controls applicable to any audit.
Customer shall be solely responsible for any and all costs / expenses pertaining to such an audit.
BrowserStack may object in writing to an auditor appointed by the Customer to conduct any audit if the auditor is, in BrowserStack’s reasonable opinion, not suitably qualified or independent, a competitor of BrowserStack, or otherwise manifestly unsuitable. Any such objection by the BrowserStack will require the Customer to appoint another auditor or conduct the audit itself.
If BrowserStack declines to follow any instruction requested by Customer regarding audits or inspections, Customer is entitled to terminate this DPA and the Agreement. If the Standard Contractual Clauses apply, except for providing clarification on their implementation, nothing in this Section varies or modifies the Standard Contractual Clauses nor affects any supervisory authority’s or data subject’s rights under the Standard Contractual Clauses.

2 Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defence, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society are, inter alia, internationally recognised sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-laundering reporting requirements.

Clause 6
Liability
1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.
2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
Clause 7
Mediation and jurisdiction
1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:
(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

Ireland.
Clause 9
Governing Law
The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established, namely
Clause 10
Variation of the contract
The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.
Clause 11
Subprocessing
1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law.
