Unless otherwise provided herein, all terms starting with a capital letter shall have the meaning ascribed to them in such Terms of Use.

1. Definition and nature of Personal Data
During the use of the Aircall services (the “Services”) subscribed via the website https://aircall.io (hereinafter referred to as the “Site”), Aircall.io., Inc., a Delaware corporation, located at 33 W 17th St, New York, NY 10011 and its subsidiaries, in particular Aircall SAS, a French société par actions simplifiée (SAS) whose registered office is at 11-15, rue Saint Georges, 75009 Paris (France), registered with the Paris Registre du commerce et des sociétés under No. 807 437 595 (“We”, “Us”, “Our” or “Aircall”) may require from Your organization which subscribed to the Services (“You”, “Your” or the “Subscriber”) to provide Us with Personal Data to access and use the Services, or You may need or happen to provide Us with Personal Data for the same purposes. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, the term “Personal Data” means any data or information that enables the identification of an individual (whether directly or indirectly), such as their family name, first name, photograph, post address, email address, telephone number, data relating to their transactions with You, detail of their orders and subscriptions placed with You, IP address, voice, as well as any other information about them that You provide Us with. It also relates to any personal information of Your employees, agents or representatives provided to Us for the purpose of using the Services.

2. Purpose of this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy applies to any individual accessing and using the Services directly or indirectly, whether You make or receive a call. By using the Services, You, Your employees, agents and representatives shall be deemed to agree to, and be obligated to comply with, the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may amend the terms of this Privacy Policy from time to time and shall give You notice thereof by email or via a pop-up on the Site. If You do not agree with the amended version of the Privacy Policy, You should stop using the Services as any use of the Services following such notice constitutes Your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. All amended terms automatically become effective on the sooner of: a) the day You use the Services; or b) ten (10) days after the new Privacy Policy is posted on the Site, provided that You did not inform Aircall of Your refusal of the new version of it, which would amount to a termination notice of the Services with immediate effect, with all due consequences as provided in the Terms of Use.

Should We add new consent-based processing of Personal Data, We shall ensure to obtain Your consent therefor prior to processing such Personal Data (e.g. via a box to tick).

You shall remain at all times responsible for complying with all laws and regulations, in particular those regarding Personal Data, and personally liable for any breach thereof.

We may indeed process Personal Data We collect for the limited purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and thereby act as Data Controller for those limited purposes only. However, and outside of the scope of these limited instances, You shall be considered the Data Controller, and we shall act solely as a Data Processor, as regards the processing of Your information for the purpose of providing the Services.

In that capacity and within the scope of the Services, You are exclusively responsible in particular for:

making any declarations necessary to the relevant data protection authority;
complying with its obligations as Data Controller under all applicable laws and regulations informing you about their Data Processing practices and, if required, obtaining your explicit consent when collecting your Personal Data;
ensuring they have the authority to use any Personal Data collected in accordance with the defined purposes and refraining from any unauthorized use.
3. Purposes
The table below indicates the different purposes Personal Data may be processed for, as well as their different categories, the legal basis the processing is based on, their recipients* and applicable retention period.
You may contact Us to obtain the list of Our sub-processors.

4. Recipients of the collected Personal Data
Only Our personnel, the services in charge of control (especially: external auditor) and Our recipient subcontractors listed in the above table may have access to any Personal Data. Personal Data may also be disclosed in response to lawful requests made by government agencies or public authorities, including public officers or debt collection organizations, to meet national security, law enforcement or any other legal requirements. In any event, Aircall shall remain liable in cases of onward transfers to third parties.

Depending on where You are located, we might have to enforce local regulations and requirements where the use of a local phone number requires to keep user details (in particular, first/last name and address) in the event we should receive an official request from a competent local authority.

5. Transfer / sale of personal databases
We shall not, without Your agreement, sell or let Personal Data to third parties. We shall only transfer Personal Data to another location, whether physical or numerical, if strictly necessary to provide the Services, or if You specifically agree with it.

6. Retention of Personal Data
6.1 General provisions
Where Aircall is the Data Controller of Personal Data (for example, Personal Data relating to the Site visitors, or individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the Personal Data we collect where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide them with our Services, to enable their participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process Personal Data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because Personal Data has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store it and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

If Personal Data is processed for, on behalf of, or for the purpose of the Services taken out by, any Subscriber, we will process Personal Data for as long as we are instructed to do so by the relevant Subscriber that is the Data Controller of such Personal Data.

Personal Data shall be stored for the duration of Your use of the Services as well as for the different renewal periods, and for the purposes listed above.

We may retain Personal Data to comply with Our legal or regulatory obligations. In any case, upon ceasing or lifting of such obligations, Personal Data shall be removed from our systems and records, as well as that of our subcontractors, if any, or otherwise archived or anonymized so that they can no longer be identified.

6.2 Provisions specific to credit / debit card and bank account details
We do not store any bank information or credit details on Our servers, provided that they are handled by a trusted third party independent and different from Aircall.

6.3 Notice to end-users
Our Services are intended for use by enterprises. Where our Services are made available to you through a Subscriber of ours, that enterprise is the Data Controller of your personal information. Your data privacy questions and request should initially be submitted to said Subscriber in its capacity as your Data Controller. Aircall is not responsible for our Subscribers’ privacy or security practices which may be different than this Privacy Policy.

Aircall’s Subscribers are able to:

restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services;
access and describe your personal information that you provided to them;
access and export your personal information processed by them; and
amend your personal information, including your end-user profile.
7. Personal Data Transfer outside of the European Union
Personal Data may be transferred, accessed to and stored in a country located outside the EEA. Personal Data can also be processed by individuals working outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) who work for Us or for one of Our trusted service providers, such as Our hosting providers (Amazon). In any case, Personal Data are only transferred in a secure manner and in compliance with the applicable regulations. As some countries may not have laws governing the use and transfer of Personal Data, we undertake to take all necessary steps to ensure that third parties comply with the terms and conditions set out in this Privacy Policy. These measures may include controlling the standards applied by such third parties with respect to Personal Data protection and security, and/or the execution of appropriate agreements to deal with such transfers (e.g. the standard contractual clauses adopted by the Commission of the European Union).

Aircall commits to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and comply with the advice given by such authorities.

Aircall abides by and has certified adherence to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce. For more information on the Privacy Shield frameworks, and to view the scope of Aircall’s certification, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact us by email to privacy@aircall.io. For residual Privacy Shield disputes that cannot be resolved by the methods above, you may be able to invoke a binding arbitration process under certain conditions. To find out more about the Privacy Shield’s binding arbitration scheme, please see: https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction

The Federal Trade Commission has investigation and enforcement authority over our compliance with the Privacy Shield.

If we have received Personal Data under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfer it to a third-party service provider for processing, we will remain responsible if they process Personal Data in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

8. Safety / Security
We undertake to implement all necessary precautions, as well as the appropriate organizational and technical measures, to maintain the security, integrity and confidentiality of Personal Data, and in particular to prevent them from being modified or damaged and stop any unauthorized third party from accessing them. In particular, our employees’ accounts are secured by strong passwords, and they are all bound by confidentiality obligations. We also use state-of-the art secured payment systems consistent with applicable regulation. However, You agree that no data transmission over the Internet, or information storage technology, can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

section of the Agreement which addresses the exclusion and limitation of liability
even if it does not have that heading), and any reference in such section to the

substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it
will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which

subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the
damage suffered.
2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with
paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his
subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because
the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become
insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the
19
data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the
entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which

importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor
of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data

against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the
Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity

or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such
entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing
operations under the Clauses.

substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of
national or international law.
Clause 8
Cooperation with supervisory authorities

authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data
protection law.

20
legislation applicable to it or any subprocessor preventing the conduct of an audit of
the data importer, or any subprocessor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the

Clause 9
Governing Law

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on
behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the
data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses,
with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement
with the subprocessor which imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are
imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil
its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall
remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the subprocessor's
obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also
provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where
the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in
paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they
have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent
and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or
data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the
subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.
3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract
referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the
data exporter is established.
4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the
Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be
updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data
protection supervisory authority.

Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services
1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services,
the data importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return
all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall
destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless
legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all
or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it
will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively
process the personal data transferred anymore.
2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter
and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an

In addition to the above restrictions and in order to provide the best pricing, support and Services, Aircall reserves the right to: (i) impose limits on Customer and/or its Users’ usage of the Services; (ii) charge Customer the applicable per minute rate; (iii) or to terminate the Services, in each case (i) through (iii) notwithstanding Customer’s purchase of an unlimited minute plan, if Aircall believes, in its sole reasonable discretion, that Customer’s and or its Users’ usage, including, but not limited to, the total number of calls made and/or minutes used by Customer and/or its Users is not consistent with normal, fair, and reasonable use of such Services. Wherever reasonably possible, Aircall will provide Customer with a written notice before taking any such action, and may allow a reasonable period to allow Customer to modify such use.

The restrictions contained in this Section 5 are not exhaustive or exclusive. Aircall may impose additional restrictions upon notice or posting to the Site from time to time. Aircall may suspend or terminate the Services and/or this Agreement immediately and without notice or liability whatsoever if, in Aircall’s sole discretion, Customer’s, its Users’ and/or Administrator’s use of the Services violates the terms of the PUP. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement and in addition thereto, Customer’s use of the call recording functionality must comply with any and all local laws and regulations including local notice requirements thereof.

6. Aircall Numbers
6.1 Usage Rules. As part of the Services, Aircall may make available Aircall Numbers to Customer in multiple countries. Aircall has agreements in place with regulated providers of electronic communications which provide Aircall with phone numbers from multiple countries. The provision of Aircall Numbers is subject to the numbering rules and regulatory practices applicable in the countries where Customer and and/or Users are located as well as in the relevant country(ies) from which the Aircall Numbers were purchased. Such rules and regulatory practices may change or be amended from time to time, and Aircall therefore reserves the right to modify the terms hereunder to the extent necessary to comply with such changes or amendments. Customer may purchase Aircall Numbers and assign them to an Account subject to the allocation requirements displayed upon Customer’s subscription to any Services. Customer shall use the Aircall Numbers in compliance with any and all applicable Law including such applicable allocation requirements. Aircall reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel the subscribed Aircall Numbers for any or no reason, including in the event Customer, its Administrators and/or Users breach such applicable allocation requirements without penalty and without prejudice to its rights to claim damages therefore.

6.2 Portability. In using the Services, Customer may request an Aircall Number or may port its existing numbers (“Existing Number”) into Customer’s Account subject to the terms and conditions herein. In order to request the porting of an Existing Number into an Account, the Account Administrator for the Account into which Customer wishes the Existing Number to be ported must complete all steps listed on the Site and provide all information requested by Aircall, any other relevant service provider and/or third party from time to time. Customer must provide accurate and detailed information to Aircall any other relevant service provider and/or third party in order to port a number into an Account and Customer represents and warrants that such information is and will be at all times accurate, true and up-to-date. Customer acknowledges and agrees that as part of the porting process, Aircall, any other relevant service provider and/or third party must, as part of its compliance with applicable Laws and industry standards, follow certain processes and that therefore the completion of any number porting request may be delayed for reasons outside of Aircall’s control. Aircall must, by Law, comply with all valid porting requests. Phone numbers may be ported-out of an Account in connection with acts or omissions of third parties and Customer acknowledges that: (i) it may be impossible for Aircall to prevent such porting out of numbers from an Account; (ii) Aircall may not be able to retrieve a phone number ported out of an Account; and (iii) Aircall shall not be liable for any such porting out. Upon termination or cancelation of an Account, all telephone numbers associated with the Account may be released by Aircall if such numbers have not been ported to another provider prior to such cancelation or termination. Customer acknowledges and agrees that it is solely responsible for coordinating with its new third-party provider to port out any telephone numbers prior to termination or cancellation of Customer’s Account and/or termination of this Agreement.

7. Pricing & Invoicing
7.1 Free Trial. Customer may elect to try the Services for a period of up to five (5) business days from the Effective Date and shall be permitted to make outbound calls for a total of up to forty (40) minutes (such trial of the Services, the “Free Trial”). At the end of the Free Trial period, Customer may purchase additional products and services not included in the Free Trial by selecting a Plan.

7.2 Fixed Fees. Customer may select a Plan on a monthly basis or on an annual basis and Customer may also select the corresponding currency for such Plan (either Euros or USD), and unless otherwise provided in the relevant Order Form, the fees associated to such Plan shall be indicated on the Site (such fees, the “Fixed Fees”). Additional Aircall Numbers purchased by Customer either via the Aircall Dashboard or listed in the relevant Order Form, as applicable shall also be deemed Fixed Fees. For the avoidance of doubt, fees associated with outbound calls or inbound calls (where applicable) shall not be included in the Fixed Fees. Fixed Fees may be updated by Aircall at any time, and such updated Fixed Fees shall be applicable during the next period of each Plan Term or the Order Form Term, as applicable.

7.3 Usage Fees. The fees associated with outbound calls or inbound calls, where applicable, shall be calculated by multiplying the per-minute rate applicable to such calls (“Per-Minute Rates”) with the Chargeable Time (as defined below) (such fees, the “Usage Fees”). Telephony usage and the duration of calls shall be calculated as follows: (i) in full-minute increments; (ii) calls shall be rounded up to the next full minute increment at the end of each call for invoicing purposes; (iii) calls will be deemed to begin when a connection to the number Customer is trying to reach is established and recorded in Aircall’s system, and for incoming calls when a signal connection from the caller is recorded in Aircall’s system; (iv) calls will be deemed to end when Customer or Customer’s correspondent have ended the call or where the call has ended due to a technical malfunction, but a call shall not be deemed ended until Customer’s wireless telephone signal of a call disconnect is recorded in the Aircall system; (such calculation of the duration of calls as detailed in (i) through (iv) included, “Chargeable Time”). Aircall may change the Per-Minute Rates at any time without notice. Customer may request the Per-Minute Rates currently applicable by sending a request to sales@aircall.io.

The Services shall be subject to the following conditions:

a) Outbound calls made by Customer with a local/toll-free phone to countries outside of the European Union will incur Usage Fees; b) inbound calls to Customer are free regardless of whether they come from a foreign country or not, provided they are made to a local or geographic telephone number (non-toll-free); c) all inbound calls on a toll-free phone line shall incur Usage Fees; d) any internal calls or communications (including but not limited to calls, voicemail deposits and call transfers) between Users, or between a User and an Administrator, shall be free of charge provided such calls have been made using the Services; e) outbound calls for which Aircall receives answer supervision (i.e. connecting time) including ring time, shall incur a minimum of one (1) minute of Chargeable Time (answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment); f) calls forwarded to mobile phones or landlines shall be deemed outbound calls and shall incur Usage Fees including in the event Customer has purchased an unlimited outgoing/incoming call bundle, at the then applicable rate; and g) calls received by Customer from a third party using a local/toll-free phone line which call is subsequently forwarded or transferred shall be deemed to be the same call.

7.4 Payment. By providing a valid credit or debit card information and/or bank account information (“Payment Method”), Customer expressly: (i) authorizes Aircall and/or any other company or individual acting as Aircall’s billing agent to charge the Payment Method: (x) monthly for fees corresponding to the Usage Fees; at the billing frequency chosen and specified by Customer on the relevant Order Form or Purchase, as applicable, for fees corresponding to Fixed Fees (the “Billing Frequency”); and (z) for any and all other fees in connection with the Services including recurring payments billed on a monthly or annual basis and and to continue attempting to charge and/or place holds on such Customer’s Payment Method until such amounts are paid in full; (ii) agrees to update such Payment Method from time to time as necessary; and (iii) acknowledges and agrees that Aircall shall not be liable for any expired credit/debit card, insufficient funds or other charges Customer incurred as a result of such attempts to charge, and/or place holds on, such Payment Method. In the event Customer selects a Plan that includes a predetermined allotment of services, unless otherwise specifically provided as a part of such Plan, any unused allotment of such services from one billing cycle will not carry over to any future billing cycle.

7.5 Taxes. The Fees are exclusive of VAT (where applicable), costs/disbursements, charges, or any other duties, levies, registration fees or taxes which shall be charged additionally. The invoiced amount and/or amounts charged to the Payment Method may hence fluctuate from month to month and Customer agree to pay all fees and/or taxes due.

7.6 Late Fees. Pursuant to article L.441-6 of the French Commercial Code, and subject to any future amendment thereof, any balance remaining outstanding on any invoice after thirty (30) days shall be automatically increased by the greater of the legal interest rate applicable in France plus seven (7) points, or the interest rate applied by the European Central Bank to its latest refinancing operation plus ten (10) points. In addition, Aircall shall be entitled to a forty (40)-euro administrative recovery fee for any late payment. Interests are capitalised in accordance with the provisions of article 1343-2 of the French Civil Code. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing and in addition thereto, in the event Customer fails to pay invoices due within thirty (30) days, Aircall may, in its sole discretion, suspend Customer’s access to the Services and/or terminate this Agreement in whole or in part, without any liability whatsoever and without prejudice to its right to claim all amounts due by Customer to Aircall, as the case may be.

8. Confidentiality
8.1 Non-Disclosure. During the Term of this Agreement the Confidential Information will be kept confidential by the Receiving Party and will not be disclosed to any other person, provided that each Party may disclose Confidential Information to its Affiliates, and its and their employees, agents and subcontractors who have a need to access and/or use the Confidential Information in order to perform or exercise such Party’s rights or obligations under this Agreement and who are required to protect it against unauthorized disclosure in a manner no less protective than required under this Agreement. The Receiving Party shall use the same care and discretion, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care and discretion, to avoid disclosure as it uses with its own similar information that it does not wish to disclose, to safeguard the Confidential Information from unauthorized disclosure.

For purposes of this Agreement, “Representatives” shall mean a Party’s Affiliates and its and their employees, officers, directors, agents or other representatives.

9. Information Security and Privacy
9.1 Privacy. Customer shall execute the Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) available here and incorporated herein by this reference. Failure by Customer to execute the DPA may be grounds for Aircall to terminate the Services and/or the Agreement immediately and with no liability to Aircall. Aircall takes its Customer’s privacy seriously and shall use information provided by Customer in accordance with the terms contained herein and in the Site’s privacy policy available at https://aircall.io/privacy/ (the “Aircall Privacy Policy”).

9.2 Information Security. Aircall endeavours to use commercially reasonable technical and operational safeguards designed to protect the Customer Data and Customer’s Confidential Information from unauthorized use or disclosure. Customer agrees to protect all devices permitting access to the Services using industry-standard security measures. Aircall may from time to time push software updates and patches and Customer agrees to promptly install and implement such updated, patched, and/or upgraded version of the Services. Aircall will not be responsible or liable for any damage or inoperability of the Services resulting from Customer’s failure to timely implement such update, patch and/or upgrade.

10. Warranties

To the extent permissible by applicable Law, Aircall will pass through to Customer the relevant and applicable warranties it receives from its third-party suppliers where applicable.

10.2 Customer Warranties. Customer represents and warrants that it will and will cause its Users and/or Administrators to use the Services in compliance with all applicable Laws and this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that the Services include ringtones and music that are made available to Customer under a licence that requires that the name of its author be mentioned. Customer therefor represents and warrants that it will add, as part of the services that it offers, the information that Aircall shall provide Customer with, and in particular display the name of the tunes’ authors, and more generally that Customer will comply with the terms of this licence.

10.3 Disclaimer. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, CUSTOMER AGREES THAT THE SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AIRCALL MAKES NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM A COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE, TOGETHER WITH SIMILAR WARRANTIES, WHETHER ARISING UNDER ANY LAW OR OTHERWISE. IN THE EVENT AIRCALL MAY NOT DISCLAIM ANY SUCH WARRANTY AS A MATTER OF LAW, THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF SUCH WARRANTY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. AIRCALL FURTHER DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE, UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, CONTINUOUS, ERROR-FREE OR WILL OPERATE WITHOUT PACKET LOSS, NOR DOES AIRCALL WARRANT ANY CONNECTION TO OR TRANSMISSION FROM THE INTERNET, OR ANY QUALITY OF CALLS MADE THROUGH THE SERVICES. CUSTOMER ALSO ACKKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT AIRCALL CANNOT GUARANTEE THAT IP BASED COMMUNICATIONS ARE COMPLETELY SECURE, ERROR OR VIRUS-FREE.

These Terms of Use, and any Dispute resulting therefrom, shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the french Commercial court (Tribunal de commerce de Paris). The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of these Terms of Use will not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of any other provision.

15. Force Majeure
Excluding either Party’s payment obligations under the Agreement, neither Party will be responsible or liable for any failure to perform or delay in performing to the extent resulting from any event or circumstance that is beyond that Party’s reasonable control, including without limitation any act of God; national emergency; third-party telecommunications networks; riot; war; terrorism; governmental act or direction; change in Laws; fiber, cable, or wire cut; power outage or reduction; rebellion; revolution; insurrection; earthquake; storm; hurricane; flood, fire, or other natural disaster; strike or labor disturbance; or other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to the foregoing, not resulting from the actions or inactions of such Party.

17. Amendments
Except as otherwise provided, this Agreement may only be modified by a written amendment (provided electronically or otherwise) executed by authorized representatives of both Parties. In no event will handwritten changes to any terms or conditions, including in the applicable Order Form, be effective. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, Aircall may update the terms of this Agreement or any of its policies from time to time, and will provide notice to Customer at the email address on file with the Account or via a pop-up on the Site, as decided by Aircall in its sole discretion. Such updates will become effective ten (10) days after such notice to Customer (such date, the “Updated Date”). In the event that any such update would be of material detriment to Customer and is not required by Law, Customer must inform Aircall of Customer’s objection within ten (10) days of receiving the notice provided under this provision.

Any use of the Services after the Updated Date will be deemed as Customer’s acceptance of such updates to the terms of this Agreement and/or policies, as applicable.

18. General Provisions
Customer and Aircall are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between Customer and Aircall. Aircall’s failure or delay in exercising any right herein will not operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or future exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right herein. This Agreement, together with any Order Form(s), Purchases, Exhibits and/or Schedules, each of which is expressly incorporated into this Agreement with this reference, constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties and supersedes and replaces any and all prior or contemporaneous understandings, proposals, representations, marketing materials, statements, or agreements, whether oral, written, or otherwise, regarding such subject. In the event that the terms of this Agreement and the terms of an Order Form conflict the terms of the Order Form shall prevail. Sections 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, and 18 included shall survive termination of this Agreement. Aircall reserves the right to refuse to provide the Services at its sole discretion to any Customer. In the event of a conflict between the French version of these Terms and Conditions and the English version of the Terms and Conditions the English version shall prevail. For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of Customer, each Order Form may be signed Customer or any of its Affiliates, provided Customer will remain liable for any and all actions or omissions of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement.
