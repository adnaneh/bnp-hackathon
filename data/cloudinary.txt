As an APN Advanced Technology Partner, Cloudinary is audited annually to the AWS Well-Architected Framework.

Cloudinary runs a security bug bounty program , enabling globally crowdsourced vulnerability detection. This means that our systems are under constant scrutiny by dozens of security researchers, who we reward for responsible disclosure.

Cloudinary scales to over 300,000,000 image transformations a day sustained, with peaks of over 1 billion a day. We have an internal incident response procedure that is activated in case of a DDoS attack to begin specific mitigations such as country blocking and pattern blocking.

Cloudinary APIs are fully authenticated and secured and allow delivering media over http or https. The API also returns a JSON response with all asset details at a “notification_url” that you set.

Cloudinary uses third party penetration testing to probe our APIs and web applications for vulnerabilities.

Cloudinary security team tracks both known and unreleased vulnerabilities and regularly patches the system to address these.

Cloudinary facilitates geographic isolation with regional redundant data centers and backups within our tier-1 cloud providers in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.
