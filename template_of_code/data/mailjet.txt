Privacy Policy
Last revised and updated 10/29/2020. To review a changelog and see the previous version, click here.



Your privacy and security is of the utmost importance to us. We describe in this policy how we collect and use information about you in your use of our services, including our platform and the website. If you are one of our customers, you should read this policy in conjunction with our Terms of Service.

1. Who are we?
We are Mailgun Technologies, an email service provider. The processing explained in this policy may be carried out by Mailgun or other data controllers in the Mailgun group of companies (including its subsidiaries). All references in this policy to “Mailgun”, “Mailjet”, “we” “us” or “our” should be interpreted accordingly and refer to the Mailgun Group.
When collecting information about our customers or visitors of our website, we are, under European Union (“EU”) data protection laws, qualified as “data controller”. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold and use personal data about you.

2. How do we collect your data?
We collect information about you when you fill in a sign up or contact form on our website or send us an email. We may also receive your personal data from third parties, when you express your interest for our services to them.
We collect information by automated means. When you visit our website, view one of our advertisements on a third party-owned website, or read our marketing email, we automatically collect information about you via cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies. These are small files associated with information that your browser or our servers will save and return as part of your use of the website and the services for purposes such as saving your login session between visits, remembering your display preferences and tracking your use of the website. For more information on our use of cookies, read our cookies notice.

3. What data do we collect?
We collect two types of information about you: personal data and non-personal data.

Personal data. This is information that lets us know who you are. This includes the information you provide us when registering to use the platform (i.e. your name, company name, email address, postal address, other contact information you share with us, associated domain name and credit card information). Your login credentials are also personal data. This category also includes information tied to your identity that you provide us through other means, such as emails to our support team.

Non-personal data. This is information that doesn’t let us determine your identity. This generally comes from your use of the services after registering on our website. Non-personal data includes information that could personally identify you in its original form, but that we have modified (for instance, by aggregation) any personal data.

In addition, and in the context of using our services, namely creating and sending emails, we have access to the information contained in the subject and content of the emails that you send out, as well as the email contacts you send to via our services.

The data you submit should not include any sensitive personal data, such as Government identifiers (i.e. social security, driving licence, or taxpayer identification numbers), complete credit card or complete personal bank card numbers, medical records or particulars connected with applications for care or treatment associated with private individuals.

4. How do we use your data?
If you are a visitor of our website, we use your personal and non-personal data to engage with you and support live chat conversations on the website.

When you are one of our customers, we use the information we collect about you to provide the services to you. As part of that purpose, we use your data:

1. to create and maintain your platform account, and to control access to it;
2. to provide our services and facilitate performance, including verifications relating to you;
3. to provide you with real-time logs of your use of the platform;
4. to respond to any requests you may submit for support or sales information, or similar communications;
5. to communicate with you about our services (for example through newsletters, marketing emails, announcements or special offers);
6. for billing and collection purposes, if you have subscribed to one of our paid plans;
7. for the investigation and prevention of fraud and breaches of the Terms of service;
8. to enable third parties to provide services to us;
9. for customers that request allocated dedicated IP addresses, for the purposes of assigning the dedicated IP address to that customer;
10. personalise, assess, and improve our services, content and materials;
11. to comply with applicable laws to which we are subject.

We may use your non-personal data to enhance the services, for instance through web analytics or troubleshooting. We may also use aggregated or depersonalized information to promote our services, such as by citing usage statistics.

5. What are our purposes and legal basis for collecting your personal data?
We collect your personal data because we need it to perform a contract we have signed with you or because you have taken steps to enter into a contract with us (for instance, when you fill in a contact form to request information about our services or when you sign up for an account). Otherwise, we collect personal data based on your consent for that specific purpose.

6. With whom do we share personal data?
Except for the limited circumstances we describe here or in an applicable agreement or our Terms of service, we do not share your personal data with third parties. When we need to provide your personal data to third parties, we will only share it to the extent necessary to provide you with our services, and we ensure that we have in place data protection requirements with these third parties (including standard contractual clauses as well as the requisite technical and organisational measures).

We may also share your personal data as required or permitted by law and as to optimally provide our services through third party providers as described below.

Hosting Services: We host the website and operate the platform using third parties, including Google Cloud Platform, AWS® and Rackspace®. Your platform will be hosted from their data centers throughout the United States or Europe, based on where you have selected to deploy our services.

Payment Providers: We use a Stripe® and Chargify, to process subscription payments, and therefore provide them with the personal data required to charge your credit card and maintain any payment mandate information as law requires.

Website functionalities: We may use third-party services either embedded into our website (such as Drift, Optimizely, VWO, Segment™ and Google® Analytics) or outside of it (such as GitHub®, Unbounce and Twitter®) to communicate with you or to enhance the function of the website and the services.
Customer engagement: We use third-party service providers and platforms (such as Gainsight, Customer.io, Salesforce, Uservoice, Zapier, and Zendesk) for customer engagement, customer chat, product feedback and customer support ticketing.

IP addresses: We may share your contact information with ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) for the purposes of fulfilling your request to re-assign the dedicated IP addresses.
While we provide these third parties with no more information than what is necessary to enable them to provide the services to us, any information that you provide these services providers independently is subject to their respective privacy policies and practices.

In no case do we sell, share or rent out your contacts to third parties, nor use them for any purpose other than those set forth in this policy.

In certain situations, we may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities or regulatory bodies, including to meet law enforcement requirements, in the case of a court order, a summons to appear in court or any other similar requisition from a government or the judiciary, or to establish or defend a legal application.

Additionally, we will provide information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

7. For how long do we retain your personal data?
We keep your personal data for as long as is necessary to provide our services to you (unless otherwise required by law).

If you would like us to cease all of the described uses of your personal data, you may delete your account at any time from the Account Settings section of our Dashboard. This will delete your personal data from our records, and we will make no further use of it. We may, however, retain copies of your personal data in backups for legal retention purposes and/or for our own legitimate business purposes.

8. How do we transfer your data?
Mailgun complies with the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) as well as all applicable data protection laws. For all transfers of personal data from the EU and EEA, we maintain EU Standard contractual clauses where necessary, ensure additional safeguards such as data encryption and data minimization, as well as perform audits and controls on our important sub processors.

You can request to sign our Data Processing Agreement which lists out all our important sub processors used and the measures in place to ensure proper data protections.

9. What are your rights in connection with personal data?
In accordance with Data Protection laws, you have the right to:

1. Request access to your personal data. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
2. Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
3. Request erasure of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no legitimate reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
4. Withdraw your consent and opt-out from our communications. We will honor your opt-out within 14 days. Please note that you cannot unsubscribe from service-related messages if you remain a customer.
5. Object to processing of your personal data, for example, if we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this basis.
6. Request the restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal data about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
7. Request the transfer of your personal data (right to data portability).

If you want to exercise any of the above rights, please email our privacy team at privacy@mailgun.com. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.

Mailgun commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. EU individuals with inquiries or complaints should first contact our Data Protection Officer at: privacy@mailgun.com.

Mailgun has also committed to cooperate with the panel established by the EU data protection authorities with regard to unresolved complaints concerning personal data transferred from the EU.

If you are located in the EU, you also have the right to lodge a complaint to your data protection authority.

10. Security
The security and integrity of your personal information is very important to us. We follow industry accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received. We ensure the appropriate electronic, physical and managerial procedures are in place with a view to safeguarding and preserving all the data handled. Our infrastructure is located in top-tier data centers. Each of these locations adhere to strict physical and procedural controls which are frequently audited. Our applications are routinely scanned for vulnerabilities and an independent penetration test is conducted annually. Our employees undergo background checks (when allowed) and sign non-disclosure agreements at the time of hire.

Remember, though, that some parts of the services are public and that email, by its nature, is not a reliably private means of communication. If you voluntarily provide personal data in a public area of the website, unrelated parties online will be able to view it and collect it. If you don’t want to make this information publicly available, you shouldn’t post it.

11. Changes
The information provided in this policy may be modified to address new issues or changes. If we make significant changes, we may notify you by other means (for instance, by email or with a banner on the website) prior to the change becoming effective. Any changes we make will take effect 30 days after the update date noted above. If you object to the changes, email us at privacy@mailgun.com before the new effective date to delete your information from our records.

In addition, you agree that Mailgun may disclose message routing data to third parties in aggregate statistical form, provided that Mailgun does not include any information that could be used to identify you.

8.3 Usage Data. Mailgun collects and stores information related to your use of the Services, such as use of the Website, API, SMTP and filtering choices and usage. You agree that Mailgun may use this information for our general business purposes and may disclose the information to third parties in aggregate statistical form, provided that Mailgun does not include any information that could be used to identify you.

9. LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES

9.1 Direct Damages. Notwithstanding anything in the Agreement to the contrary, except for liability arising from death or personal injury caused by negligence, willful misconduct, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other loss or damages for which such limitation is expressly prohibited by applicable law, the maximum aggregate monetary liability of Mailgun and any of its Representatives in connection with the Services or the Agreement under any theory of law shall not exceed the total amount paid for the Services that are the subject of the claim in the twelve months immediately preceding the event(s) that gave rise to the claim.

9.2 Indirect Damages. Neither party (nor any of our Affiliates or Representatives) is liable to the other for any indirect, special, incidental, exemplary or consequential loss or damages of any kind. Neither of us is liable for any loss that could have been avoided by the damaged party’s use of reasonable diligence, even if the party responsible for the damages has been advised or should be aware of the possibility of such damages. In no event shall either of us be liable to the other for any punitive damages or for any loss of profits, data, revenue, business opportunities, customers, contracts, goodwill or reputation.

9.3 SLA Credits. The credits stated in any applicable SLA are your sole and exclusive remedy for Mailgun’s failure to meet those guarantees for which credits are provided. The maximum total credit(s) for failure to meet any applicable SLA for any calendar month shall not exceed one hundred percent of the then current monthly recurring fee for the Services. Credits that would be available but for this limitation will not be carried forward to future months. You are not entitled to a credit if you are in breach of the Agreement at the time of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the credit until you have remedied the breach. No credit will be due if the credit would not have accrued but for your action or omission.

10. INDEMNIFICATION

10.1 If Mailgun, its Affiliates, or any of its or their Representatives (the “Indemnitees”) is faced with a legal claim by a third party arising out of your actual or alleged: willful misconduct, breach of applicable law, failure to meet the security obligations required by the Agreement, breach of your agreement with your customers or end users, violation of the AUP, or your breach of Section 5 (Intellectual Property) then you will pay the cost of defending the claim (including reasonable legal fees) and any damages award, fine or other penalty that is imposed on the Indemnitees as a result of the claim. Your obligations under this Section include claims arising out of the acts or omissions of your employees or agents, any other person to whom you have given access to the Customer Configuration, and any person who gains access to the Customer Configuration as a result of your failure to use reasonable security precautions, even if the acts or omissions of such persons were not authorized by you.

10.2 Mailgun will choose legal counsel to defend the claim, provided that the choice is reasonable and is communicated to you. You must comply with our reasonable requests for assistance and cooperation in the defense of the claim. Mailgun may not settle the claim without your consent, which may not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. You must pay costs and expenses due under this Section as Mailgun incurs them.

11. NOTICES

Your routine communications to Mailgun regarding the Services should be sent to your account team using the Control Panel. To give a notice regarding termination of the Agreement for breach, indemnification, or other legal matter, you must send it by electronic mail and first-class post to:

Mailgun Technologies, Inc., Legal Department , 112 E Pecan St #1135, San Antonio, TX 78205
Mailgun’s routine communications regarding the Services and legal notices will be posted on the Control Panel or sent by email or post to the individual(s) you designate as your contact(s) on your account. Notices are deemed received as of the time posted or delivered, or if that time does not fall on a business day, as of the beginning of the first business day following the time posted or delivered. For purposes of counting days for notice periods, the business day on which the notice is deemed received counts as the first day.

12. PUBLICITY, USE OF MARKS

Unless otherwise agreed in the Service Order, you agree that Mailgun may publicly disclose that it is providing Services to you and may use your name and logo to identify you in promotional materials, including press releases. You may not issue any press release or publicity regarding the Agreement, use the Mailgun name or logo or other identifying indicia, or publicly disclose that it is using the Services without Mailgun’s prior written consent.

13. ASSIGNMENT/SUBCONTRACTORS

Neither party may assign the Agreement or any Service Orders without the prior written consent of the other party except to an Affiliate or successor as part of a corporate reorganization or a sale of some or all of its business, provided the assigning party notifies the other party of such change of control. Mailgun may use its Affiliates or subcontractors to perform all or any part of the Services, but Mailgun remains responsible under the Agreement for work performed by its Affiliates and subcontractors to the same extent as if Mailgun performed the Services itself.

You acknowledge and agree that Mailgun Affiliates and subcontractors may be based outside of the geographic jurisdiction in which you have chosen to store Customer Data and if legally required the parties will enter into good faith negotiations of such agreements as are necessary in order to legitimize the transfer of Customer Data.

14. FORCE MAJEURE

Neither party will be in violation of the Agreement if the failure to perform the obligation is due to an extraordinary event beyond its control, such as significant failure of a part of the power grid, Internet failure, natural disaster, war, riot, epidemic, strikes or labor action, terrorism (“Force Majeure”).

If a Force Majeure event occurs, this Agreement shall be automatically suspended during the time the Force Majeure event continues, and neither Party shall be liable to the other for non-performance or delay in the performance of required obligation(s) due to the Force Majeure event, provided the non-performing Party gives prompt written notice of its inability to perform specified obligation(s) due to the event and uses reasonable efforts to resume its performance of its obligation(s) as soon as possible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall a Force Majeure event excuse or delay a Party’s obligation(s) with respect to confidentiality or Intellectual Property Rights.

15. GOVERNING LAW
15.1 The Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, exclusive of any choice of law principle that would require the application of the law of a different jurisdiction, and the laws of the United States of America including the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §1, et seq. Any dispute or claim relating to or arising out of the Agreement shall be submitted to binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the state and county (or equivalent geographic location) of the non-asserting party’s principal business offices in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in effect at the time the dispute or claim arose. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator from AAA or a comparable arbitration service. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned award with findings of fact and conclusions of law. Either party may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to compel arbitration under this Agreement, or to enforce an arbitration award. Neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties.

Either party shall be permitted to appeal the final award under the AAA’s Optional Appellate Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the dispute or claim arose. Grounds for vacating the award shall include, in addition to those enumerated under the Federal Arbitration Act, that the arbitrator committed errors of law that are material and prejudicial. The appeal shall be determined upon the written documents submitted by the parties, with no oral argument. After the appellate rights described herein have been exercised or waived, the parties shall have no further right to challenge the award.

15.2 Notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction provision above, you agree that Mailgun may seek to enforce any judgment anywhere in the world where you may have assets. No claim may be brought as a class or collective action, nor may you assert such a claim as a member of a class or collective action that is brought by another claimant. Each of us agrees that Mailgun will not bring a claim under the Agreement more than two years after the time that the claim accrued. The Agreement shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

15.3 The prevailing party in any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement shall be entitled to recover reasonable legal fees and costs, including attorney’s fees.

16. MISCELLANEOUS

16.1 Some terms are incorporated into the Agreement by reference to pages on the Mailgun website and Mailgun may revise those terms from time to time (including these Terms of Service). Such revisions will be effective and supersede and form part of the Agreement as of the time (i) you enter into a new Service Order referencing the terms subject to the revisions or (ii) a Service Order automatically renews pursuant to the Agreement in which case you acknowledge that you have reviewed and accept the then-current version of the terms as of the date of the renewal. If there is a conflict between the terms of the Agreement, the documents will govern in the following order: the Service Order, then these Terms of Service. The headings or captions in the Agreement are for convenience only. If over time you enter into multiple Agreements for a given Customer Configuration (for example to add additional components or services) then the most recent terms referenced in the Service Order(s) will govern the entirety of the Services for the given Customer Configuration.

16.2 Unless otherwise expressly permitted in the Agreement the terms of the Agreement may be varied only by a written agreement signed by both parties that expressly refers to the Agreement. A Service Order may be amended to modify, add, or remove services by a formal written agreement signed by both parties, or by an exchange of correspondence (including via the Mailgun ticketing system) that includes the express consent of an authorized individual for each of us. The pre-printed terms of your purchase order or other business form or terms that you provide shall be void and of no effect.

16.3 If any part of the Agreement is found unenforceable, the rest of the Agreement will continue in effect, and the unenforceable part shall be reformed to the extent possible to make it enforceable and give business efficacy to the Agreement. Each party may enforce its respective rights under the Agreement even if it has waived the right or failed to enforce the same or other rights in the past. The relationship between the parties is that of independent contractors and not business partners. Neither party is the agent for the other and neither party has the right to bind the other on any agreement with a third party.

16.4 The following provisions in these Terms of Service shall survive expiration or termination of the Agreement: Intellectual Property, Confidential Information, Indemnification, Limitation on Damages, Governing Law, Notices, Miscellaneous, all terms of the Agreement requiring you to pay any fees for Services provided prior to the time of expiration or termination, or requiring you to pay an early termination fee, and any other provisions that by their nature are intended to survive expiration or termination of the Agreement.

16.5 The Agreement constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding between the parties regarding its subject matter and supersedes and replaces any prior or contemporaneous representation(s), agreement(s) or understanding(s), written or oral.

ANNEX 1
INFORMATION SECURITY – TECHNICAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL MEASURES
Where personal data is processed or used automatically, Mailgun’s internal organization ensures that it meets specific requirements of data protection by utilizing security best practices. In particular, Mailgun implements the following measures to protect personal data or other sensitive data categories.

Physical Access Control

To prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to data processing systems with which personal data is processed or used:
– Mailgun leverages industry-leading data center and cloud infrastructure providers. Access to all data centers is strictly controlled. All data centers are equipped with 24x7x365 surveillance and biometric access control systems. Additionally, all providers are SOC Type II and ISO 27001 certified.
– Data centers are equipped with at least N+1 redundancy for power, networking, and cooling infrastructure.
– Within a region, data processing occurs across at least three distinct availability zones. Services are designed to withstand the failure of an availability zone without customer disruption.

System Access Control
To prevent data processing systems from being used without authorization:

– Administrative access to Mailgun systems and services follows the principle of least privilege. Access to systems is based on job role and responsibilities. Mailgun utilizes unique usernames/identifiers that are not permitted to be shared or re-assigned to another person.
– VPN and multi-factor authentication is used for access to internal support tools and product infrastructure.
– Network access control lists (ACLs) and security groups are used to limit ingress and egress traffic from production infrastructure.
– Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are used to detect potential unauthorized access.
– Network protections have been deployed to mitigate the impact of distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks.
– Onboarding and offboarding processes are documented and followed consistently to ensure access is properly managed to internal and externally hosted tools and systems. Where possible, third-party services leverage single sign-on (SSO) functionality which allows for centralized management and enforces multi-factor authentication.

Data Access Control

To ensure authorized users entitled to use data processing systems have access only to the data to which they have a right of access, and that personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization in the course of processing or use and after storage:

– Mailgun utilizes a password management system that enforces minimum password length, complexity, expiration time, and minimum last used.
– Employee workstations automatically lock after a prolonged period of inactivity. Systems log out users after a prolonged period of inactivity.
– Logs are centrally stored and indexed. Critical logs, such as security logs, are retained for at least one year.
– The Mailgun patch management process ensures that systems are patched at least once every month. Monitoring, alerting, and routine vulnerability scanning occurs to ensure that all product infrastructure is patched consistently.
– Industry-standard antivirus software is utilized to ensure internal assets that access personal data are protected against known viruses. Antivirus software is updated regularly.
– Mailgun utilizes firewalls to segregate unwanted traffic from entering the network. A DMZ is utilized using firewalls to further protect internal systems protecting sensitive data.

Data Transmission Control

To ensure that personal data cannot be read, copied, modified or removed without authorization during electronic transmission or transport:
– Customer data is stored encrypted-at-rest through the use of AES-256 encryption on block devices.
– Customer backups are encrypted-in-transit and at rest using strong encryption.
– Mailgun supports TLS 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2 to encrypt network traffic between the client application and Mailgun infrastructure. Customers can control and manage encryption settings for messages processed by Mailgun and sent to receiving mailbox providers to achieve compliance needs beyond the scope of Mailgun’s external certifications.
– Mailgun is alerted to encryption issues through periodic risk assessments and third-party penetration tests. Mailgun performs third-party penetration tests on an annual basis, or as needed due to changes in the business.
– Mailgun operates a bug bounty program, encouraging the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities from community researchers.

Input Control

To ensure that it is possible to check and establish whether and by whom personal data have been input into data processing systems, modified or removed:
– Systems are monitored for security events to ensure quick resolution.
– Logs are centrally stored and indexed. Critical logs, such as security logs, are retained for at least one year. Logs can be traced back to individual unique usernames with timestamps to investigate nonconformities or security events.

Availability Control

To ensure personal data is protected from accidental destruction or loss:
– Account data is backed up at least daily. Incremental/point-in-time recovery is available for all primary databases. Backups are encrypted-in-transit and at rest using strong encryption.
– Mailgun patch management process ensures that systems are patched at least once every month. Monitoring, alerting, and routine vulnerability scanning occurs to ensure that all product infrastructure is patched consistently.
– When necessary, Mailgun patches infrastructure in an expedited manner in response to the disclosure of critical vulnerabilities to ensure system uptime is preserved.
– Customer environments are logically separated at all times. Customers are not able to access accounts other than those given authorization credentials for.

HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1.

Clause 1
Definitions

For the purposes of the Clauses:

(a) ‘personal data’, ‘special categories of data’, ‘process/processing’, ‘controller’, ‘processor’, ‘data subject’ and ‘supervisory authority’ shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data*;
* Parties may reproduce definitions and meanings contained in Directive 95/46/EC within this Clause if they considered it better for the contract to stand alone.

(b) ‘the data exporter’ means the controller who transfers the personal data;

(c) ‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;

(d) ‘the sub processor’ means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other sub processor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;

(e) ‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;

(f) ‘technical and organizational security measures’ means those measures aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing.

Clause 2
Details of the transfer

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are specified in Appendix 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.

Clause 3
Third-party beneficiary clause

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary.

2. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.

3. The data subject can enforce against the sub processor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the sub processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

4. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law.

Clause 4
Obligations of the data exporter

The data exporter agrees and warrants:

(a) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;

(b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter’s behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;

(c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organizational security measures specified in Appendix 2 to this contract;

(d) that after assessment of the requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;

(e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;

(f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;

(g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any sub processor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;

(h) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for sub processing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;

(i) that, in the event of sub processing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a sub processor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and

(j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i).

Clause 5
Obligations of the data importer*

* Mandatory requirements of the national legislation applicable to the data importer which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society on the basis of one of the interests listed in Article 13(1) of Directive 95/46/EC, that is, if they constitute a necessary measure to safeguard national security, defense, public security, the prevention, investigation, detection and prosecution of criminal offences or of breaches of ethics for the regulated professions, an important economic or financial interest of the State or the protection of the data subject or the rights and freedoms of others, are not in contradiction with the standard contractual clauses. Some examples of such mandatory requirements which do not go beyond what is necessary in a democratic society are, inter alia, internationally recognized sanctions, tax-reporting requirements or anti-money-laundering reporting requirements.

The data importer agrees and warrants:

(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;

(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;

(c) that it has implemented the technical and organizational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;

(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:

(i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,

(ii) any accidental or unauthorized access, and

(iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorized to do so;

(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;

(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;

(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for sub processing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;

(h) that, in the event of sub processing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;

(i) that the processing services by the sub processor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11;

(j) to send promptly a copy of any sub processor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter.

Clause 6
Liability

1. The parties agree that any data subject, who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or sub processor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage suffered.

2. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim for compensation in accordance with paragraph 1 against the data exporter, arising out of a breach by the data importer or his sub processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity.
The data importer may not rely on a breach by a sub processor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities.

3. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the sub processor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the sub processor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data sub processor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the sub processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

Clause 7
Mediation and jurisdiction

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:

(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

2. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law.

Clause 8
Cooperation with supervisory authorities

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

2. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any sub processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.

3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation applicable to it or any sub processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any sub processor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the measures foreseen in Clause 5 (b).

Clause 9
Governing Law

The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the Data Exporter is established.

Clause 10
Variation of the contract

The parties undertake not to vary or modify the Clauses. This does not preclude the parties from adding clauses on business related issues where required as long as they do not contradict the Clause.

Clause 11
Sub processing

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub processor which imposes the same obligations on the sub processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses. Where the sub processor fails to fulfill its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub processor’s obligations under such agreement.

2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the sub processor shall also provide for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the sub processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub processing of the contract referred to in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of sub processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.

Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data importer and the sub processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred anymore.

2. The data importer and the sub processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the measures referred to in paragraph 1.
