By using our Services, you understand that we will collect and use your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you or your organization has an individual agreement with us, that agreement may have privacy terms that also apply to the personal information you provide to us under that agreement.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party websites and apps that you may use, including any linked to in our Services. You should review the terms and policies for third-party websites and apps before clicking on any links.

DocuSign’s core product and Services help users create, complete, and show the validity of digital or electronic transactions, such as electronically signing a contract for mobile phone services or placing a digital signature on a loan application. As part of our Services, users want us to collect and record information that helps the parties prove the validity of the transactions. This information includes the persons who are involved in the transactions and the devices those persons use.

Information We Collect from Other Sources. We may collect personal information about you from others, such as:

Third-Party Sources. Examples of third-party sources include marketers, partners, researchers, affiliates (like companies connected to DocuSign), service providers, and others where they are legally allowed to share your personal information with us. For example, if you register for our Services on another website, the website may provide your personal information to us.
Other Customers. Other customers may give us your personal information. For example, if a customer wants you to sign an electronic document in our Services, he or she will give us your email address and name.
Combining Personal Information from Different Sources. We may combine the personal information we receive from other sources with personal information we collect from you (or your device) and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Personal Information We Collect & Process on Behalf of Customers. When our customers use our Services, we process and store certain personal information on their behalf as a data processor. For example, in DocuSign Signature when a customer (or the customer’s Authorized Users) uploads contracts or other documents for review or signature, we act as a data processor and process the documents on the customer's behalf and in accordance with their instructions. In those instances, the customer is the data controller and is responsible for most aspects of the processing of the personal information. If you have any questions or concerns about how personal information is processed in these cases, including how to exercise your rights as a data subject, we recommend contacting the customer.

We collect your personal information to provide and improve our Services and to support advertising and marketing. See Section 2 Use of Personal Information for additional information.

We may share your personal information with third parties as provided in Section 3 Personal Information Sharing.



2. Use of Personal Information
In general, we collect, use, store, and process your personal information to provide our Services, to fix and improve them, to develop new Services, and to market our companies and their products and Services. Here are some examples of how we use the personal information we process:

This Privacy Policy does not apply to our use of such aggregated or de-identified information.

Lawful Basis for Processing Your Personal Information. If European data protection law applies and DocuSign acts as a controller, our lawful basis for collecting and using the personal information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect or use it.

We normally collect or use personal information from you or others only where we have your consent to do so, where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.

For example, when we:

Use personal information to create and manage an account, we need it in order to provide relevant Services.
Gather and record data associated with use of a digital certificate or digital signature, it is to comply with regulations.
Use names and email addresses for email marketing purposes, we do so with your consent (which you can withdraw at any time).

7.         TERMS SPECIFIC TO DOCUSIGN SERVICES

7.1       Right to Use DocuSign Services.  Subject to these Terms, DocuSign will provide the DocuSign Services to Customers in accordance with each Customer’s Subscription Plan, and DocuSign grants to each Customer a limited non-exclusive, non-transferrable right and license during the Term, solely for its internal business purposes and in accordance with the Documentation, to: (a) use the DocuSign Services; (b) implement, configure, and, through its Account Administrator(s), permit its Authorized Users to access and use the DocuSign Services up to any applicable limits or maximums; and (c) access and use the Documentation.

7.1.1    Authorized Users.  Authorized Users of Customer must be identified by a unique email address and user name and two or more natural persons may not use the DocuSign Services as the same Authorized User. If the Authorized User is not an employee of Customer, use of the DocuSign Services will be allowed only if the user is under confidentiality and other obligations with Customer at least as restrictive as those in these Terms, and is accessing or using the DocuSign Services solely to support Customer’s internal business purposes.

7.1.2    Account Administrator. Customer may assign and expressly authorize an Authorized User(s) as its agent to manage Customer’s Account, and management of Customer’s Account includes, without limitation, configuring administration settings, assigning access and use authorization, requesting different or additional services, providing usage and performance records, managing templates, executing approved campaigns and events, assisting in third-party product integrations, and accepting notices, disclosures, and terms and conditions (“Account Administrator”). Customer may appoint an employee, agent or a third-party business partner or contractor to act as its Account Administrator(s) and may change its designation at any time through its Account.

7.2       Payment Terms.

7.2.1    Subscription Plan. The prices, features, and options of the DocuSign Services depend on the Subscription Plan selected as well as any changes instigated by Customer. DocuSign does not represent or warrant that a particular Subscription Plan will be offered indefinitely and reserves the right to change the prices for or alter the features and options in a particular Subscription Plan without prior notice.

7.2.2    No Refunds. Customer will timely pay DocuSign all fees associated with its Subscription Plan, Account, or use of the DocuSign Services, including, but without limitation, by Authorized Users. CUSTOMER’S PAYMENTS ARE NON-REFUNDABLE EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THESE TERMS. Charges for pre-paid Subscription Plans will be billed to Customer in advance. Charges for per-use purchases and standard Subscription Plan charges will be billed in arrears unless otherwise specified in the Subscription Plan.

7.2.3    Recurring Charges. When you purchase a Subscription Plan, you must provide accurate and complete information for a valid payment method that you are authorized to use. You will be billed for your Subscription Plan either through the payment method you provide, such as a credit card, or through an intermediary provider such as iTunes, Google Play, or a similar app store (“App Store”). Customer must promptly notify DocuSign of any change in its invoicing address and must update its Account with any changes related to its payment method. BY COMPLETING REGISTRATION FOR A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, CUSTOMER AUTHORIZES DOCUSIGN OR ITS AGENT TO CHARGE ITS PAYMENT METHOD ON A RECURRING (E.G. MONTHLY OR YEARLY) BASIS (“AUTHORIZATION”) FOR: (a) THE APPLICABLE SUBSCRIPTION PLAN CHARGES; (b) ANY AND ALL APPLICABLE TAXES; AND (c) ANY OTHER CHARGES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE DOCUSIGN SERVICES. The Authorization continues through the applicable Subscription Term and any Renewal Term (as defined in Section 8.2.3, below) until Customer cancels as set forth in Section 8.2 of these Terms.

7.2.4    Late Fees & Collection Costs. If DocuSign does not receive payment from Customer’s payment method, Customer agrees to pay all amounts due upon demand. Any amount not paid when due will be subject to finance charges equal to 1.5% of the unpaid balance per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law, whichever is less, determined and compounded daily from the date due until the date paid. Customer will reimburse any costs or expenses (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees) incurred by DocuSign to collect any amount that is not paid when due. DocuSign may accept payment in any amount without prejudice to DocuSign’s right to recover the balance of the amount due or to pursue any other right or remedy. Amounts due to DocuSign may not be withheld or offset by Customer for any reason against amounts due or asserted to be due from DocuSign.

7.2.5    Invoices. DocuSign will provide billing and usage information in a format we choose, which may change from time to time. DocuSign reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it identifies even if it has already issued an invoice or received payment. Customer agrees to notify us about any billing problems or discrepancies within thirty (30) days after they first appear on your invoice. If Customer does not bring such problems/discrepancies to our attention within thirty (30) days, it agrees to waive its right to dispute such problems or discrepancies.

7.2.6    Billing Cycles. Billing cycle end dates may change from time to time. When a billing cycle covers less than or more than a full month, we may make reasonable adjustments and/or prorations. Customer agrees that we may (at our option) accumulate charges incurred during a billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of a cycle, and that we may delay obtaining authorization or payment from Customer’s payment card issuer or App Store until submission of the accumulated charge(s).

7.2.7    Benefit Programs. You may receive or be eligible for certain pricing structures, discounts, features, promotions, and other benefits (collectively, "Benefits") through a business or government agreement with us ("Business Terms"). Any and all such Benefits are provided solely as a result of the corresponding Business Terms and such Benefits may be modified or terminated without notice. If you use the DocuSign Services and a business or government entity pays your charges or is otherwise liable for the charges, you authorize us to share your account information with that entity and/or its authorized agents. If you are enrolled in a Subscription Plan or receive certain Benefits tied to Business Terms with us, but you are liable for your own charges, then you authorize us to share enough account information to verify your continuing eligibility for those Benefits and the Subscription Plan.

7.2.8    Tax Responsibility. All payments required by these Terms are stated exclusive of all taxes, duties, levies, imposts, fines, or similar governmental assessments, including sales and use taxes, value-added taxes (“VAT”), goods and services taxes (“GST”), excise, business, service, and similar transactional taxes imposed by any jurisdiction and the interest and penalties thereon, excluding taxes based on DocuSign’s net income (collectively, “Taxes”). Customer shall be responsible for and bear Taxes associated with its purchase of, payment for, access to or use of the DocuSign Services. Where the responsibility to remit Taxes falls upon DocuSign, the Taxes will be added to the payment and payable to DocuSign at the same time as the payment. Taxes shall not be deducted from the payments to DocuSign, except as required by law, in which case Customer shall increase the amount payable as necessary so that after making all required deductions and withholdings, DocuSign receives and retains (free from any Tax liability) an amount equal to the amount it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been made. Customer hereby confirms that DocuSign can rely on the name and address set forth in its registration for a Subscription Plan as being the place of supply for Tax purposes. DocuSign’s and Customer’s obligations under this Section 7.2.8 (Tax Responsibility) shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms.

7.2.9    Intermediary Provider Billing. If your Subscription Plan is based on intermediary provider billing, your intermediary provider will automatically charge your App Store account monthly for the cost of the Subscription Plan and any applicable taxes. If you are not current with your Subscription Plan payments, we reserve the right to terminate your account, suspend your access to your Subscription Plan, or convert your Subscription Plan subscription to a non-subscription account. You will be responsible for paying all past due amounts.

7.3       Free Trial and Special Offers for DocuSign Services.

7.3.1    If you register for a free trial, promotional offer, or other type of limited offer for use of DocuSign Services (“Free Trial”), you may be presented with additional terms and conditions when registering for a Free Trial, and any such additional terms and conditions are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference and are legally binding. This Section 7.3 (Free Trial and Special Offers for DocuSign Services) supersedes and applies notwithstanding any conflicting provisions with regard to access and use of a Free Trial.

7.3.2    DocuSign reserves the right to reduce the term of a trial period or end it altogether without prior notice.

7.3.3    The version of the DocuSign Services that is available for a Free Trial may not include or allow access to all features or functions. ANY DATA THAT A CUSTOMER ENTERS INTO THE DOCUSIGN SERVICES, AND ANY CONFIGURATIONS MADE BY OR FOR A CUSTOMER, DURING THE FREE TRIAL WILL BE PERMANENTLY LOST AT THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD UNLESS THE CUSTOMER: (a) PURCHASES A SUBSCRIPTION PLAN TO DOCUSIGN SERVICES THAT IS EQUIVALENT TO OR GREATER THAN THOSE COVERED BY THE TRIAL; OR (b) EXPORTS SUCH DATA BEFORE THE END OF THE TRIAL PERIOD.

7.3.4    Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, including without limitation the warranties described in Section 9 (Warranties and Disclaimers) or any service-specific terms and conditions applicable to a particular DocuSign Service, including exhibits and attachments accompanying such schedule (“Service Schedule”), during a Free Trial the DocuSign Services are provided “AS IS” and “as available” without any warranty that may be set forth in these Terms, and DOCUSIGN DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND DOCUSIGN’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO CUSTOMER’S USE OF THE FREE TRIAL IS $100.

7.4       Data.

7.4.1    Data Generally. You shall be responsible for data that you provide or use in DocuSign Services. You are solely responsible for determining the suitability of the DocuSign Services for your business or organization and complying with any regulations, laws, or conventions applicable to the data you provide and your use of the DocuSign Services and Site.

7.4.2    Personal Data. Customer warrants that its collection and use of any personal information or data provided while using the Site complies with all applicable data protection laws, rules, and regulations. Customer and its Authorized Users acknowledge that DocuSign may process such personal data in accordance with the DocuSign Privacy Policy (https://www.docusign.com/company/privacy-policy).

7.5       Customer Warranties.  Customer hereby represents and warrants to DocuSign that: (a) it has all requisite rights and authority to use the DocuSign Services under these Terms and to grant all applicable rights herein; (b) it is responsible for all use of the DocuSign Services associated with its Account; (c) it is solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of its Account names and password(s); (d) it agrees to immediately notify DocuSign of any unauthorized use of Customer’s Account of which it becomes aware; (e) it agrees that DocuSign will not be liable for any losses incurred as a result of a third party's use of its Account, regardless of whether such use is with or without its knowledge and consent; (f) it will use the DocuSign Services for lawful purposes only and subject to these Terms; (g) any information it submits to DocuSign is true, accurate, and correct; and (h) it will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the System or the DocuSign Services, other accounts, computer systems, or networks under the control or responsibility of DocuSign through hacking, cracking, password mining, or any other unauthorized means.

7.6       Confidentiality.

7.6.1    Confidential Information. “Confidential Information” means (a) for DocuSign and its Affiliates, the DocuSign Services and Documentation; (b) for Customer and its Affiliates, Customer Data; (c) any other information of a party, including its Affiliates, that is disclosed in writing or orally and is designated as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure (and, in the case of oral disclosures, summarized in writing within thirty (30) days of the initial disclosure and delivered to the Recipient), or that due to the nature of the information the Recipient would clearly understand it to be confidential information of the disclosing party; and (d) the specific terms and conditions of these Terms, and any amendment and attachment thereof, between the parties. Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) was or becomes generally known to the public through no fault or breach of these Terms by the Recipient; (ii) was rightfully in the Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure without restriction on use or disclosure; (iii) was independently developed by the Recipient without use of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information; or (iv) was rightfully obtained by the Recipient from a third party not under a duty of confidentiality and without restriction on use or disclosure. All information provided to DocuSign that is not Confidential Information will be treated in accordance with the DocuSign Privacy Policy (https://www.docusign.com/company/privacy-policy).

7.6.2    Restricted Use and Nondisclosure. During and after the Subscription Term, the party receiving Confidential Information (“Recipient”) will: (a) use the Confidential Information of the other party solely for the purpose for which it is provided; (b) not disclose such Confidential Information to a third party, except on a need-to-know basis to its attorneys, auditors, consultants, and service providers who are under confidentiality obligations at least as restrictive as those contained herein; and (c) protect such Confidential Information from unauthorized use and disclosure to the same extent (but using no less than a reasonable degree of care) that it protects its own Confidential Information of a similar nature. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer expressly authorizes DocuSign to use and process Customer Data as described in the DocuSign Privacy Policy, which provides for, but is not limited to, delivering eDocuments as indicated by Customer’s use of the DocuSign Services and sharing Transaction Data (as defined in the Signature Schedule) with individuals who are authorized to view, approve or sign eDocuments created by Customer.

7.6.3    Required Disclosure. If DocuSign is required by law to disclose Confidential Information, DocuSign will give prompt written notice to Customer before making the disclosure, unless prohibited from doing so by the legal or administrative process, and assist Customer to obtain where reasonably available an order protecting the Confidential Information from public disclosure.

7.6.4    Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, DocuSign acknowledges that, as between the parties, all Confidential Information it receives from Customer, including all copies thereof in Recipient’s possession or control, in any media, is proprietary to and exclusively owned by Customer. Nothing in these Terms grants DocuSign any right, title or interest in or to any of the Customer’s Confidential Information. DocuSign’s incorporation of the disclosing party’s Confidential Information into any of its own materials will not render Confidential Information non-confidential.

8.         TERM AND TERMINATION

8.1       Termination – Site Visitors. A Site Visitor may terminate its use of the Site at any time by ceasing further use of the Site. DocuSign may terminate your use of the Site and deny you access to the Site in our sole discretion for any reason or no reason, including for violation of these Terms.

8.2       Term and Termination – Customers.

8.2.1    Suspension of Access to DocuSign Services. DocuSign may suspend any use of the DocuSign Services, remove any content or disable or terminate any Account or Authorized User that DocuSign reasonably and in good faith believes violates these Terms. DocuSign will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you prior to any such suspension or disablement, unless DocuSign reasonably believes that: (a) it is prohibited from doing so under applicable law or under legal process, such as court or government administrative agency processes, orders, mandates, and the like; or (b) it is necessary to delay notice in order to prevent imminent harm to the DocuSign Services or a third party. Under circumstances where notice is delayed, DocuSign will provide the notice if and when the related restrictions in the previous sentence no longer apply.

8.2.2    Term. The period of effectiveness of these Terms (“Term”), with respect to DocuSign Services, begins on the date the Customer accepts it and continues until the Customer’s Subscription Plan expires or its use of the DocuSign Services ceases (including as a result of termination in accordance with this Section 8.2), whichever is later.

8.2.3    Subscription Term and Automatic Renewals. DocuSign’s Subscription Plans automatically renew unless otherwise noted. If you purchase a Subscription Plan you agree to pay the then-current applicable fee associated with the Subscription Plan and further agree and acknowledge that it will automatically renew, unless, prior to the end of the current period of effectiveness of the Subscription Plan (“Subscription Term”): (a) you terminate your Account; (b) you set your Account not to auto-renew by logging in to DocuSign Services or contacting us here: (https://support.docusign.com/contactsupport); (c) DocuSign declines to renew your Subscription Plan; or (d) these Terms are otherwise properly terminated as expressly permitted herein. The Subscription Plan will automatically renew on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the method you choose (“Renewal Term”).

Promotional codes may only be used for your first Subscription Term. If you purchased your Subscription Plan with a promotional code, each time your Subscription Plan renews you will be charged the full annual billing amount. If your Subscription Plan is ever terminated for any reason, and you purchase another Subscription Plan, you shall not be eligible to use a promotional code.

We reserve the right to modify, terminate, or otherwise amend the fees and features associated with your Subscription Plan. We may also recommend that you purchase a new Subscription Plan that is comparable to your previous Subscription Plan that is ending. Before we change the fees and charges in effect, or add new fees and charges, we will give you advance notice of at least thirty (30) days. If we provide you such advance notice, your continued use of the DocuSign Services after the changes have been made will constitute your acceptance of the changes. If you do not wish to continue subscribing with the new fees or features, you may terminate your Subscription Plan as described in Section 8.2.4. If you accept the new Subscription Plan, its terms and conditions with these Terms will apply in the Renewal Term and thereafter.

8.2.4    Termination by Customer. You may terminate your Account at any time upon ten (10) days’ advance written notice to DocuSign. If you wish to terminate, you must provide notice by contacting us here: (https://support.docusign.com/contactsupport). If you purchased your Subscription Plan through an external service, such as an App Store, you must use the tools made available by those services to manage and/or terminate your Subscription Plan. Section 7.2.2 notwithstanding, if a Customer terminates its annual Subscription Plan within the first thirty (30) days of the initial Subscription Term, it may submit a written request to DocuSign for a refund of the fees paid to DocuSign for the initial Subscription Term, which DocuSign will consider, without obligation, in good faith. DocuSign has no obligation to consider refund requests related to a termination of a Subscription Plan if the termination does not occur in the first thirty (30) days of the initial Subscription Term, or if there has been a violation of other Terms herein, or if records indicate substantial productive use took place during that period.

8.2.5    Default; Termination by DocuSign. A Customer will be in default of these Terms if: (a) it fails to timely pay any amount owed to us or an Affiliate of ours; (b) it or an Authorized User associated with its Account breaches any provision of these Terms or violates any published policy applicable to the DocuSign Services; (c) it is or becomes subject to any proceeding under the Bankruptcy Code or similar laws; or (d) if, in our sole discretion, we believe that continued use of the DocuSign Services by the Customer (or its Authorized Users or signers) creates legal risk for DocuSign or presents a threat to the security of the DocuSign Services or DocuSign’s customers. If a Customer is in default, we may, without notice: (i) suspend its Account and use of the DocuSign Services; (ii) terminate its Account; (iii) charge reactivation fees in order to reactivate its Account; and (iv) pursue any other remedy available to us. A DocuSign “Affiliate” means any legal entity that DocuSign, Inc. owns, that owns DocuSign, Inc. or that is under common control with DocuSign, Inc.  A Customer “Affiliate” means any legal entity that Customer owns, that owns Customer or that is under common control with Customer. “Control” and “own” mean possessing greater than 50% interest in an entity or the right to direct the management of the entity.

8.2.6    Effect of Termination. If these Terms expires or are terminated for any reason: (a) Customer will pay to DocuSign any amounts that have accrued before, and remain unpaid as of, the date of the termination or expiration, including those for the billing cycle in which termination occurs; (b) any and all of Customer’s liabilities to DocuSign that have accrued before the effective date of the expiration or termination will survive; (c) licenses and use rights granted to Customer with respect to the Site and DocuSign Services and intellectual property will immediately terminate; (d) DocuSign’s obligation to provide any further services to Customer under these Terms will immediately terminate, except any such services that are expressly to be provided following expiration or termination of these Terms; and (e) the provisions of Section 3 (Usage and Access Rights), Section 4 (Ownership), Section 5.3 (Restrictions on Use of the Site), Section 5.4 (Compliance with Terms), Section 6 (Privacy), Section 7.2.2 (No Refunds), Section 7.2.7 (Benefit Programs), Section 7.2.8 (Tax Responsibility), Section 7.3 (Free Trial and Special Offers for DocuSign Services), Section 7.4 (Data), Section 7.6 (Confidentiality), Section 8.2.6 (Effect of Termination), Section 9 (Warranties and Disclaimers), Section 10 (Indemnification Obligations), Section 11 (Limitations of Liability), and Section 12 (General) will survive, as well as provisions designated to survive under any Service Schedules and accompanying attachments and Exhibits to these Terms.

9.2       THE DOCUSIGN PARTIES MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS THAT DOCUSIGN SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE HAVE BEEN AND WILL BE PROVIDED WITH DUE SKILL, CARE AND DILIGENCE OR ABOUT THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THE DOCUSIGN SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE CONTENT AND ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY: (i) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT; (ii) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF DOCUSIGN SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE; (iii) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SERVERS AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION AND/OR FINANCIAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN; (iv) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE SITE; (v) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE THAT MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE SITE THROUGH THE ACTIONS OF ANY THIRD PARTY; (vi) ANY LOSS OF YOUR DATA OR CONTENT FROM THE SITE; AND/OR (vii) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT OR FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, EMAILED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA DOCUSIGN SERVICES, DOCUMENTATION, AND SITE. YOU WILL NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE OR PASS ON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY ON BEHALF OF DOCUSIGN TO ANY THIRD PARTY.

IN THAT EVENT, SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LIMITED TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY AND FOR THE MINIMUM WARRANTY PERIOD ALLOWED BY THE MANDATORY APPLICABLE LAW.

9.3       THE DOCUSIGN PARTIES DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY PRODUCT OR SERVICE ADVERTISED OR OFFERED BY A THIRD PARTY THROUGH THE SITE, AND THE DOCUSIGN PARTIES WILL NOT BE A PARTY TO OR IN ANY WAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MONITORING ANY TRANSACTION BETWEEN YOU AND THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

9.4       If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” This release includes the criminal acts of others.

9.5       Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages such as in this Section 9 or below in Section 11. Accordingly, some of these limitations may not apply to you. If you are a New Jersey resident, or a resident of another state that permits the exclusion of these warranties and liabilities, then the limitations in Section 9 and Section 11 specifically do apply to you.

10.1     You will defend, indemnify, and hold us, our Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, suppliers, consultants, and agents harmless from any and all third-party claims, liability, damages, and costs (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees) arising from or related to, as applicable: (a) your access to and use of the Site; (b) violation of these Terms by you or your Account Administrator(s) or Authorized Users, as applicable; (c) infringement of any intellectual property or other right of any person or entity by you; (d) the nature and content of all Customer Data processed by the DocuSign Services; or (e)  any products or services purchased or obtained by you in connection with the Site.

You agree not to settle any matter in which we are named as a defendant and/or for which you have indemnity obligations without our prior written consent. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding upon becoming aware of it.

11.       LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY

11.1     Disclaimer of Consequential Damages.

11.1.1  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS, DOCUSIGN WILL NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, COVER, PUNITIVE, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THESE TERMS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, OR LOSS OF BUSINESS, EVEN IF APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH LOSSES, AND WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE MADE BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

11.1.3  Some countries and jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of consequential, direct, indirect, or other damages in contracts with consumers and to the extent you are a consumer the limitations or exclusions in this Section 11.1 may not apply to you.

11.2     Cap on Damages. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS OR TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WILL NOT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO DOCUSIGN FOR THE DOCUSIGN SERVICE(S) GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY, OR $100, WHICEVER IS GREATER. THE EXISTENCE OF MORE THAN ONE CLAIM SHALL NOT ENLARGE THIS LIMIT.

11.3     Independent Allocations of Risk. Each provision of these Terms that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages represents an agreed allocation of the risks of these Terms between the parties. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these Terms, and each of these provisions will apply even if the warranties in these Terms have failed of their essential purpose.

11.4     Jurisdictional Limitations.

11.4.1  Because some states and jurisdictions do not allow limitation of liability in certain instances, portions of the above limitation may not apply to you. In that event, such exclusions and limitations shall apply to the maximum extent permitted by applicable mandatory law (and our liability shall be limited or excluded as permitted under mandatory applicable law). If you are a New Jersey resident, the limitations in Section 11 specifically do apply to you.

11.4.2  DocuSign’s liability to you if you are domiciled in Germany is limited as described in Section 12.9 below.

The party affected by the force majeure event will provide notice to the other party within a commercially reasonable time and will use commercially reasonable efforts to resume performance as soon as practicable.

12.7     Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class Actions Applicable to Customers.

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.

12.7.1 You agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 12.7 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior; and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property as provided below.

12.7.2 Initial Dispute Resolution. Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action you will contact us at legal@docusign.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an Account). Except for intellectual property, you and DocuSign agree to use their reasonable efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with DocuSign, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.

12.7.3 Binding Arbitration. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims (except as provided below) subject to these Terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms, the parties' relationship with each other, and/or your use of the DocuSign Services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by JAMS in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Procedure Rules for claims that do not exceed $250,000 and the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures for claims exceeding $250,000 in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions.

12.7.4 Arbitrator’s Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

12.7.5 Filing a Demand. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration that includes a description of the claim and the amount of damages you seek to recover (you may find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.jamsadr.com); (b) Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee, to JAMS, Two Embarcadero Center, Suite 1500, San Francisco California 94111; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at: legal@docusign.com.

12.7.6 Fees & Costs. If your claim(s) total is less than US $5,000.00, then: (a) you may choose whether your participation in the arbitration will be conducted on the basis of documents provided to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing or by an in-person hearing; (b) DocuSign will reimburse your filing fees up to a maximum of US $1,500.00 unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous; and (c) DocuSign will not seek attorney’s fees and costs, unless the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous. You are responsible for your own attorneys' fees unless the arbitration rules and/or applicable law provide otherwise.

12.7.7 No Jury Trial. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration section, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.

12.7.8 Venue. Arbitration shall be initiated and take place in in San Francisco, California, United States, and you and DocuSign agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco, California in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

12.7.9 Class Action Waiver. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND DOCUSIGN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

12.7.10 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property. Notwithstanding the parties' decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations, or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy, or unauthorized use of intellectual property in any state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights).

12.7.11 Survival. This Mandatory Arbitration, Waiver of Class Actions section shall survive any termination of your use of the Site.

12.8     Entire Terms. These Terms, which include the language and paragraphs preceding Section 1, are the final, complete, and exclusive expression of the agreement between you and DocuSign regarding the DocuSign Services provided under these Terms. These Terms supersede and the parties disclaim any reliance on previous oral and written communications (including any confidentiality agreements pertaining to the DocuSign Services under these Terms) with respect to the subject matter hereof and apply to the exclusion of any other terms that you seek to impose or incorporate, or which are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing. DocuSign hereby rejects any additional or conflicting terms appearing in a purchase order or any other ordering materials submitted by Customer and conditions assent solely based on these Terms and conditions of these Terms as offered by DocuSign. Except as explicitly permitted in these Terms, no modification or amendment of these Terms shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized agent of the party against whom the modification or amendment is being asserted. In the event of an inconsistency or conflict, the order of precedence in descending order of control is as follows: (a) the Subscription Plan; (b) any attachments or appendix(ices) to the Service Schedule(s); (c) the Service Schedule; and (d) these Terms.

12.9     Provisions for Customers Domiciled in Germany. The provisions of this Section 12.9 apply only to Customers who are domiciled in Germany when entering into these Terms.

12.9.1  DocuSign shall be fully liable for intentional and gross negligence, as well as for any damages arising from injury to life, body or health caused by DocuSign. In the case of liability for slight negligence, DocuSign shall be liable only for breach of a material obligation (“Cardinal Duty”) and any such liability shall be limited to typical, foreseeable damages and shall not include liability for lack of economic results, loss of profit, or indirect damages. A Cardinal Duty in the meaning of this Section 12.9.1 is an obligation, the fulfillment of which is essential to the performance of these Terms and on the fulfillment of which the contracting party may therefore rely.

12.9.2  If you are a consumer, nothing in these Terms affects your rights under mandatory German law and these Terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in compliance with mandatory consumer protection laws of Germany. Notwithstanding Section 12.7 above and Section 12.10 below, if you are a consumer, you may submit a claim to enforce your rights under these Terms to the competent courts in Germany.

12.10   Governing Law & Venue. These Terms will be interpreted, construed, and enforced in all respects in accordance with the local laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to its choice of law rules to the contrary. For purposes of determining the governing law, you and DocuSign agree that DocuSign is the proponent of these Terms. Notwithstanding Customer’s and DocuSign’s agreement to mandatory arbitration, either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction in San Francisco, CA, as necessary to protect the party's rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. Customer and DocuSign submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of, and venue in, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in San Francisco, California, U.S.A.

12.11   Language and Translations. DocuSign may provide translations of these Terms or other terms or policies. Translations are provided for informational purposes and if there is an inconsistency or conflict between a translation and the English version, the English version will control.

12.12   Waiver. The waiver by either you or DocuSign of any breach of any provision of these Terms does not waive any other breach. The failure of any party to these Terms to insist on strict performance of any covenant or obligation in accordance with these Terms will not be a waiver of such party’s right to demand strict compliance in the future, nor will the same be construed as a novation of these Terms.

12.13   Severability. If any part of these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the remaining portions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. If any material limitation or restriction on the grant of any license to you under these Terms is found to be illegal, unenforceable, or invalid, the license will immediately terminate.

12.14   How to Contact Us.

2.1.1    DocuSign Signature facilitates the execution of eDocuments between the parties to those eDocuments.

Customer is responsible for properly: (a) configuring DocuSign Signature; (b) using and enforcing controls available in connection with DocuSign Signature (including any security controls); and (c) taking such steps, in accordance with the functionality of DocuSign Signature, that Customer deems adequate to maintain appropriate security, protection, deletion, and backup of Customer Data, which include controlling the management of Authorized Users’ access and credentials to DocuSign Signature, controlling Customer Data that is Processed by DocuSign Signature, and controlling the archiving or deletion of eDocuments in the System.

(“DPA”) applies to the processing of any Personal Data (as defined in Section 1 of the DPA).

5.         ACCOUNTS & ORGANIZATIONAL ADMINISTRATION

5.1       Each Account is associated with a single email address. If the domain of the primary email address associated with an Account is owned by a business or other organization (“Entity”) and was assigned to Customer as an employee, contractor or member of the Entity, such as yourname@youremployer.com or yourname@nonprofit.org (“Entity Email Address”), Customer grants that Entity and its Account Administrator(s) permission to: (a) identify Accounts created with an Entity Email Address; and (b) restrict or terminate access to an Account created with an Entity Email Address.

For example: (a) if Customer adds Authorized Users, DocuSign will charge the applicable subscription amount for each additional Authorized User; or (b) if Customer sends more Envelopes than are included in your Subscription Plan, DocuSign may charge for additional envelopes or assign Customer to a new Subscription Plan. Customer may also purchase optional services on a periodic or per-use basis. DocuSign may change the prices for or alter the features and options in a particular Subscription Plan without notice.

7.         DOCUSIGN PAYMENTS

7.1       DocuSign Signature may be ordered with “DocuSign Payments,” which means functionality that allows Customer to submit agreements, invoices, and other documents to Signers via DocuSign Signature to facilitate the submission of Signer payment credentials and authorizations directly to payment applications, gateways, processors, and service providers that store, process, or transmit cardholder data as part of authorization or settlement (“Payment Applications”).

7.2       DocuSign’s provision of DocuSign Payments is conditioned on Customer’s acknowledgement of and agreement to the following:

7.2.1    The payment processing activities facilitated through DocuSign Payments are between Customer and a Payment Application or another third party designated by Customer and not with DocuSign. Customer is solely responsible for registering and maintaining an account with Payment Applications to facilitate the payment processing via DocuSign Payments and for complying with all agreements, terms of use, or other terms and conditions between Customer and such Payment Applications. Payment Applications are independent contractors and not agents, employees, or subcontractors of DocuSign. DocuSign does not control the payment methods (i.e., credit card, debit card, ACH transfer) made available by the Payment Applications through DocuSign Signature nor the products or services that are sold or purchased by Customer via DocuSign Payments. Customer acknowledges and agrees that DocuSign cannot ensure that a Payment Application Signer or third party will complete a payment processing or that it is authorized to do so.

7.2.2    Customer authorizes DocuSign to store, process, and transmit Customer Data as necessary for a Payment Application to facilitate payment processing between Customer and a third party designated by Customer.
