### DOCUMENT/ Zoom Privacy Statement / https://zoom.us/privacy#_Toc44414836 ###
Zoom Privacy Statement
Zoom Video Communications, Inc., and its subsidiaries, affiliates and parent companies (“Zoom”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have a positive experience when you use our video conferencing and communication services (the “Services”), visit our webpages, interact with us on social media, or attend a Zoom sponsored event offline or online.

This Statement explains Zoom’s practices when we process your “personal data,” which is information that relates to an identified or identifiable individual. To “process” or “processing” means any use of personal data including, transferring, collecting, recording, storing, using, analyzing, combining, disclosing or deleting it.

This Statement may be updated periodically. If we plan to make any material changes to the way we handle personal data as described here, we will notify you by posting an updated version of this Statement on our website. Changes to this Statement are summarized in our Change Log. We may supplement this Statement with “just-in-time” notices, or other disclosures contained within or in connection with the provision of the Services, which may describe in more detail our data collection, use and sharing practices. Unless we say otherwise, such supplemental privacy statements will govern how we may process the information in the context of the specific product or service.

What this Statement Covers
This Statement applies to the personal data we process as a data controller, that is, as the party that determines what data to collect and why. You provide some of this data directly, and we get some of it by collecting data about your interactions, use, and experiences with the Services. The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with Zoom and the choices you make, including the products and features you use. We also obtain data about you from third parties.

When you use Zoom’s Services through a Zoom account holder, such as your employer or school, the processing of your personal data is determined and administered by that account holder under its privacy policies. If you have questions about how and why your personal data is collected, the legal basis for processing, or requests regarding your personal data, please refer to the account holder’s privacy statement and direct your inquiries to the account holder or its administrator.

Supplementary Information
Being Considered for a Job at Zoom
Please see our Candidate Privacy Statement for supplemental information on the personal data we process in connection with our recruiting efforts.

Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a resident of the State of California, this Privacy Statement is supplemented by our California Privacy Rights Statement that explains your California privacy rights and how you can exercise these rights.

Zoom for Government
The following section on Zoom for Government (ZfG) supplements this Privacy Statement. Where terms differ, this section takes precedence.

ZfG is hosted in the United States in a separate cloud authorized by FedRAMP and is accessible by way of a separate website (www.zoomgov.com).  If you use the ZfG service:

All data collected about you while using the ZfG service or the ZfG website is stored in the United States of America;
Your data is only processed by Zoom in accordance with FedRAMP “moderate impact level” control standards;
The sections in this Statement related to data handling outside the United States do not apply to the personal data collected by Zoom about you in connection with your use of the ZfG service or ZfG website;
With regard to the Zoom App Marketplace, we do not allow third parties to use any personal data obtained from us for their own purposes, unless it is with your consent (e.g. when you download an app from the Zoom for Government Marketplace: https://marketplace.zoomgov.com/).
Zoom and Children
Zoom does not knowingly allow children under the age of 16 to sign up for their own accounts. Primary and secondary schools or districts register to use Zoom’s video communications platform through a “K-12/Primary and Secondary Account.” Please see Zoom’s K-12/Primary and Secondary Privacy Statement for additional information. Where terms differ, as with the limitations on advertising in K-12 Accounts, the K-12/Primary and Secondary Privacy Statement takes precedence.

Zoom App Marketplace & Other Sites, Mobile Applications and Services
This Privacy Statement does not apply to any third-party applications or software that you elect to add to the Services (“Third Party Services”), or any other third-party websites, mobile applications, or online products, services or businesses you may access from the Services. When you download an App from the Zoom App Marketplace, for example, the app publisher provides its own terms of service, privacy policy and support information. Please review that information carefully.

Personal Data We Process & How We Use It
The table below describes Zoom’s processing of personal data as a data controller. The table does not cover customer content, including any personal data about you that may be contained in customer content—such as meeting or call recordings or transcripts—because the customer (the Zoom account holder), rather than Zoom, controls how customer content is processed. Any questions about the processing of customer content should be addressed to the customer directly.

Customer Content
Customer content is the “in-session” information you give us directly through your use of the Services, such as meeting recordings, files, chat logs, and transcripts, and any other information uploaded while using the Services. Zoom uses customer content only in connection with providing the Services – we do not monitor, sell or use customer content for any other purposes.

We do not control the actions of anyone with whom you or any other Service user may choose to share information. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that any customer content you or any user provides to the Services will not be viewed by unauthorized persons. Nor can Zoom control the information a user may choose to share during a meeting. Although Zoom account holders can set privacy options that limit access to certain areas of the Services, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and that we are not responsible for circumvention of any security measures contained on the Services. You should be cautious about the access you provide to others when using the Services, and the information you choose to share when using the Services.

Zoom’s Product and Marketing Pages
Zoom generally processes personal data in two different manners using its websites and apps. First, Zoom processes personal data it obtains from the webpages or mobile application interfaces that Zoom uses to provide its Services, such as the landing page a user sees after clicking on a link to join a meeting (Zoom’s “Product Pages”). Product Pages also include webpages and links that are only accessible to a Zoom account holder after they login to their Zoom account. Product Pages serve only third-party cookies that are necessary for technical support and to deliver the service. There are no interest-based advertising cookies on Product Pages.

Second, Zoom processes personal data obtained from its webpages that are accessible without logging in to a Zoom account (Zoom’s “Marketing Pages”). Marketing Pages, such as www.zoom.us, are designed to encourage sales of Zoom subscriptions. They tell you about our product, plans, and pricing, features, and other related information.

Like many companies, we use advertising services that try to tailor online ads to your interests based on information collected via cookies and similar technologies on our Marketing Pages. This is called interest-based advertising. You can get more information and opt-out of the use of cookies on our Marketing Pages by clicking the Do Not Sell My Personal Information link in the footer of this webpage. You will need to set your preferences from each device and each web browser from which you wish to opt-out. This feature uses a cookie to remember your preference, so if you clear all cookies from your browser, you will need to re-set your settings. For more information regarding cookies or similar technologies, please review our Cookie Policy.

Our Referral Program

You can use our referral program to tell others about Zoom in certain jurisdictions (where permitted under applicable law). When you do, you will be asked to provide that person’s name and email so that we can contact them. We rely on you to make sure the person you are referring to us has agreed to be contacted by us. We will send a one-time email inviting them to visit a Marketing Page. Unless that person says they want to hear more, we will only use their name and email address to send this one-time email and to maintain an activity log of our referral program where permitted by law.

How We Share Personal Data
We only share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Zoom when one of the following circumstances applies:

With Consent
We may share personal data with companies, organizations, individuals outside of Zoom and others when we have consent from an individual (as applicable).

With Zoom Partners
If Zoom received your personal data from a third-party partner and you become a Customer, Zoom may disclose select personal data to that partner or their designee for the purpose of the partnership agreement; for example, to reward a referral partner from a co-sponsored event. Zoom’s partners have contractually agreed to comply with appropriate privacy and security obligations.

For corporate transactions
We may share personal data with actual or prospective acquirers, their representatives and other relevant participants in, or during negotiations of, any sale, merger, acquisition, restructuring, or change in control involving all or a portion of Zoom’s business or assets, including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

For business purposes
We provide personal data to vendors and services providers to help us provide the Services and for Zoom’s business purposes. Examples include public cloud storage vendors, carriers, payment processor, and service provider for managing customer support tickets. Zoom contractually prohibits such vendors from using the personal data for any reason other than to provide the contracted-for services and Zoom contractually requires its vendors to comply with all appropriate privacy and security requirements.

For legal reasons
We share personal data with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Zoom if we believe that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

meet any applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies.
enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Zoom, our users or the public as required or permitted by law, including to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone.

For more information about data we disclose in response to requests from law enforcement and other government agencies, please see our Guidelines for Government Requests.

Data Subject Privacy Rights and Choices
Right to Correct or Update Your Information
If you would like to correct or update information that you have provided to us, please logon to www.zoom.us and update your profile.

Marketing Communications
You may receive marketing email communications from us where permissible. If you would like to stop receiving these communications, you can update your preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in those emails.

European Privacy Rights
If you reside in the European Economic Area, you may have the right to exercise certain privacy rights available to you under applicable laws. We will process your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes or to complete transactions that you began prior to requesting any deletion.

Right not to provide consent or to withdraw consent. We may seek to rely on your consent in order to process certain personal data. Where we do so, you have the right not to provide your consent or to withdraw your consent at any time. This does not affect the lawfulness of the processing based on consent before its withdrawal.
Right of access and/or portability. You may have the right to access the personal data that we hold about you and, in some limited circumstances, have that data provided to you so that you can provide or “port” that data to another provider.
Right of erasure. In certain circumstances, you may have the right to the erasure of personal data that we hold about you (for example if it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was originally collected).
Right to object to processing. You may have the right to request that Zoom stop processing your personal data and/or to stop sending you marketing communications.
Right to rectification. You may have the right to require us to correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal information.
Right to restrict processing. You may have the right to request that we restrict processing of your personal data in certain circumstances (for example, where you believe that the personal data we hold about you is not accurate or lawfully held).
Right to lodge a complaint to your local Data Protection Authority. If you are an EEA resident, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal data.
How to Exercise Your Rights
To exercise any of the rights above, email us at privacy@zoom.us. You may also submit a request to the following address:

Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

Attention: Data Privacy Officer

55 Almaden Blvd, Suite 600

San Jose, CA 95113

Please identify yourself and specify your request. If you have a password protected Zoom account, we will use your account information to verify your identity. If not, we will ask you to provide additional verification information. What we request will depend on the nature of your request, how sensitive the information is, and how harmful unauthorized disclosure or deletion would be.

We use commercially reasonable efforts to delete your personal data as required but retain records necessary to comply with a governmental authority or applicable federal, state, or local law. Where legally permitted, we may decline to process requests, including requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, or jeopardize the privacy of others.

International Transfers
Zoom operates globally, which means personal data may be stored and processed (for example stored in a data center) in any country where we or our service providers have facilities or hold events. By using Zoom or providing personal data for any of the purposes stated above, you acknowledge that your personal data may be transferred to or stored in the United States or in other countries around the world. Such countries may have data protection rules that are different and less protective than those of your country.

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), and your personal data is transferred outside of the EEA, we will:

Process it in a territory which the European Commission has determined provides an adequate level of protection for personal information; or
Implement appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information, including transferring it in accordance with applicable transfer mechanism, including the European Commission's standard contractual clauses .
Retention
We will retain personal data for as long as required to do what we say we will in this Statement, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include:

The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our services);
Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or
Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
Customers can delete their own accounts.

Security
Zoom is committed to protecting your personal data. We use reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data. If you have any questions about the security of your data, please contact our security team at security@zoom.us

Exhibit A

Binding Arbitration

This Exhibit A to the TOS describes the further provisions which apply to the Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver.

Disputes. A dispute is any controversy between You and Zoom concerning the Services, any software related to the Services, the price of the Services, Your account, Zoom’s advertising, marketing, or communications, Your purchase transaction or billing, or any term of this Agreement, under any legal theory including contract, warranty, tort, statute, or regulation, except disputes relating to the enforcement or validity of Your or Zoom’s intellectual property rights. As part of the best efforts process to resolve disputes, and prior to initiating arbitration proceedings, each party agrees to provide notice of the dispute to the other party, including a description of the dispute, what efforts have been made to resolve it, and what the disputing party is requesting as resolution, to legal@zoom.us.
Small Claims Court Available. You may initiate an action in your local Small Claims Court if You meets the court’s requirements. However, if such a claim is transferred, removed or appealed to a different court, Zoom reserves the right to require arbitration.
Arbitration Procedure. Disputes not resolved pursuant to Section A or B shall be resolved through arbitration. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will conduct any arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. For more information, see www.adr.org. Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of Your primary business location. A single arbitrator will be appointed. The arbitrator must: (a) follow all applicable substantive Law; (b) follow applicable statutes of limitations; (c) honor valid claims of privilege; (d) issue a written decision including the reasons for the award. The arbitrator may award damages, declaratory or injunctive relief, and costs (including reasonable attorneys’ fees). Any arbitration award may be enforced (such as through a judgment) in any court with jurisdiction. Under AAA Rules, the arbitrator rules on his or her own jurisdiction, including the arbitrability of any claim; however, a court has exclusive authority to enforce the prohibition on arbitration on a class-wide basis or in a representative capacity .
Arbitration Fees. If You are unable to afford the arbitration costs, Zoom will advance those costs to You, subject to the arbitrator’s determination if costs should be reimbursed to Zoom if Zoom prevails. For disputes involving more than $75,000, the AAA rules will govern payment of filing fees and the AAA’s and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.
Conflict with AAA Rules. This Agreement governs if there is a conflict with the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules.
Requirement to File Within One Year. Notwithstanding any other statute of limitations, a claim or dispute under this Agreement must be filed in Small Claims Court or noticed for arbitration within one year of when it could first be filed, or such claim will be permanently barred.
Severability. If the class action waiver is found to be illegal or unenforceable as to all or some parts of a dispute, then those parts will not be arbitrated but will be resolved in court, with the balance resolved through arbitration. If any provision of this Exhibit A is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then that provision will be severed; however, the remaining provisions shall still apply and shall be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original intent of this Exhibit, inclusive of the severed provision.

Addendum.
3. Processing of Personal Data
3.1. Customer shall, in its use of the Services, at all times Process Personal Data, and provide

Data Protection Laws. Customer shall ensure that its Instructions comply with all laws, rules and
regulations applicable in relation to the Personal Data, and that the Processing of Personal Data
in accordance with Customer’s Instructions will not cause Zoom to be in breach of Applicable
Data Protection Law. Customer is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and legality of (i)
the Personal Data provided to Zoom by or on behalf of Customer; (ii) the means by which
Customer acquired any such Personal Data; and (iii) the Instructions it provides to Zoom
regarding the Processing of such Personal Data. Customer shall not provide or make available
to Zoom any Personal Data in violation of the Agreement or otherwise inappropriate for the
nature of the Services and shall indemnify Zoom from all claims and losses in connection
therewith.
3.2. Zoom shall Process Personal Data only (i) for the purposes of performing the Agreement and as

from any further Processing (except to the extent necessary for its continued hosting or
Processing required by law, rule or regulation) and shall continue to appropriately protect the
Personal Data remaining in its possession, custody, or control and, where any Authorized
Subprocessor continues to possess Personal Data, require the Authorized Subprocessor to take
the same measures that would be required of Zoom.

notifications, Customer shall visit zoom.us/subprocessors and enter the email
address to which Zoom shall send such notifications into the submission field at the
bottom of the page.
5.3.2. If the Customer reasonably objects to an engagement, Zoom shall have the right to
cure the objection through one of the following options (to be selected at Zoom's
sole discretion):
a) Zoom cancels its plans to use the subprocessor with regard to Customer's
Personal Data.
b) Zoom will take the corrective steps requested by Customer in its objection
(which remove Controller's objection) and proceed to use the subprocessor

d) Zoom provides Customer with a written description of commercially
reasonable alternative(s), if any, to such engagement, including without
limitation modification to the Services. If Zoom, in its sole discretion, cannot
provide any such alternative(s), or if Customer does not agree to any such
alternative(s) if provided, Zoom and Customer may terminate this Addendum
with prior written notice. Termination shall not relieve Customer of any fees
owed to Zoom under the Agreement.
5.3.3. If Customer does not object to the engagement of a new subprocessor within ten
(10) days of notice by Zoom, that new subprocessor shall be deemed accepted.
Zoom Global Data Processing Addendum, August 2020 5

that prevent them from unauthorized Processing of Customer Personal Data both during and
after their engagement by Zoom.

organization to act as an Authorized Subprocessor.
5.6. Zoom shall be fully liable to Customer where that Authorized Subprocessor fails to fulfil its data
protection obligations for the performance of that subprocessor’s obligations to the same
extent that Zoom would itself be liable under this Addendum had it conducted such acts or
omissions.
5.7. If Customer and Zoom have entered into Standard Contractual Clauses as described in Section 7
(International Transfers of Personal Data), (i) the above authorizations will constitute
Customer’s prior written consent to the subcontracting by Zoom of the processing of Personal
Data if such consent is required under the Standard Contractual Clauses, and (ii) the parties
agree that the copies of the agreements with Authorized Subprocessors that must be provided
by Zoom to Customer pursuant to Clause 5(j) of the Standard Contractual Clauses may have
commercial information, or information unrelated to the Standard Contractual Clauses or their
equivalent, removed by the Zoom beforehand, and that such copies will be provided by the
Zoom only upon request by Customer.
6. Security of Personal Data
6.1. Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope,
context and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the
rights and freedoms of natural persons, Zoom shall maintain appropriate technical and
organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including, but not
limited to, the security measures set out in EXHIBIT B.
6.2. Zoom shall implement such measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk
involved, including as appropriate:

Kingdom (as long as it is treated like an European Union Member State) to any countries where the
European Commission has not decided that this third country or more specified sectors within that third
country in question ensures an adequate level of protection, shall be undertaken, in particular, through
one of the following mechanisms: (i) in accordance with the Swiss-U.S. and EU-U.S. Privacy Shield
Zoom Global Data Processing Addendum, August 2020 6
Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, both available at
https://www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework (the “Privacy Shield Principles”), or (ii) the Standard
Contractual Clauses set forth in EXHIBIT D to this Addendum. For the purposes of this Addendum, to the
extent Customer is a Processor, Zoom shall be deemed a “subprocessor” within the meaning of Clause
11 of the Standard Contractual Clauses (and therefore subject to all the provisions of the Standard
Contractual Clauses applicable to importers).
8. Rights of Data Subjects
8.1. Zoom shall, to the extent required by Applicable Data Protection Law, promptly notify
Customer upon receipt of a request by a Data Subject to exercise Data Subject rights under

Customer and Customer will be responsible for responding to such request, including, where
necessary, by using the functionality of the Services.
8.2. Zoom shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing, assist the Customer by
appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfilment
of the Customer’s obligation to respond to requests for exercising the Data Subject’s rights
(regarding information, access, rectification and erasure, restriction of Processing, notification,
data portability, objection and automated decision-making) under Applicable Data Protection
Law.
9. Assistance, Personal Data Breach and Audits
9.1. Zoom shall, taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to

Customer’s review, copies of certifications or reports demonstrating Zoom’s compliance with
prevailing data security standards applicable to the Processing of Customer’s Personal Data.
9.5. In the event of a Personal Data Breach at Zoom, or at a Sub-Processor of Zoom, that relates to
Customer’s Personal Data, Zoom shall, without undue delay after becoming aware of a breach
of personal data, inform Customer of the Personal Data Breach and take such steps as Zoom in
its sole discretion deems necessary and reasonable to remediate such violation.
9.6. In the event of a Personal Data Breach, Zoom shall, taking into account the nature of the

and/or (ii) Data Subjects affected by such Personal Data Breach without undue delay.
9.7. The obligations described in Sections 9.5 and 9.6 shall not apply in the event that a Personal
Data Breach results from the actions or omissions of Customer. Zoom’s obligation to report or
Zoom Global Data Processing Addendum, August 2020 7
respond to a Personal Data Breach under Sections 9.5 and 9.6 will not be construed as an
acknowledgement by Zoom of any fault or liability with respect to the Personal Data Breach.

Subprocessing
1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of
the data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter.
Where the data importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the
data exporter, it shall do so only by way of a written agreement with the subprocessor which
imposes the same obligations on the subprocessor as are imposed on the data importer under
the Clauses1
. Where the subprocessor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such
written agreement the data importer shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the
performance of the subprocessor's obligations under such agreement.
2. The prior written contract between the data importer and the subprocessor shall also provide
for a third-party beneficiary clause as laid down in Clause 3 for cases where the data subject is
not able to bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the
data exporter or the data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to
exist in law or have become insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal
obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law. Such thirdparty liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the
Clauses.
3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for subprocessing of the contract referred to
in paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is
established.
1 This requirement may be satisfied by the subprocessor co-signing the contract entered into
between the data exporter and the data importer under this Decision.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of subprocessing agreements concluded under the Clauses
and notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5 (j), which shall be updated at least once
a year. The list shall be available to the data exporter's data protection supervisory authority.
Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data processing services
1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data processing services, the data
importer and the subprocessor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal
data transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal
data and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the
data importer prevents it from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data
transferred. In that case, the data importer warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of
the personal data transferred and will not actively process the personal data transferred
anymore.
2. The data importer and the subprocessor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or
of the supervisory authority, it will submit its data processing facilities for an audit of the
measures referred to in paragraph 1.

What is a Third-Party Subprocessor:

A subprocessor is a vendor Zoom uses to process data on behalf of our customers, who are the data controllers of that data.

Zoom’s Process for Contracting with Third-Party Subprocessors

Zoom requires its subprocessors to satisfy equivalent obligations as those required from Zoom (as a Data Processor) as outlined in Zoom's Data Processing Agreement (DPA), including but not limited to the requirements to:

process personal data following data controller's (i.e., Customer's) documented instructions (as communicated in writing to the relevant subprocessor by Zoom);
in connection with the subprocessing activities, use only personnel who are reliable and subject to a contractually binding obligation to observe data privacy and security, to the extent applicable, under applicable data protection laws;
promptly inform Zoom about any security breach; and
cooperate with Zoom to address requests from data controllers, data subjects, or data protection authorities, as applicable.
Except for as provided below, Zoom owns or controls access to the infrastructure that hosts real-time and stored personal data (should the Customer choose to store such content, e.g., recordings and transcripts). Personal data may be shifted among data centers within a region to ensure Zoom's performance and availability. Zoom also works with the listed service subprocessors below to provide the noted functionality.

The following table describes the countries and legal entities engaged in the processing and storage of personal data by Zoom acting as a data processor on behalf of its customers, the data controllers.
